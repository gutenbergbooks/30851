<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Of the contents of the present volume about a half now appears in the
<span class="smcap">English Garner</span> for the first time. Professor Arber (whose ready
acquiescence in my meddlings I wish cordially to acknowledge) had
gathered his good corn wherever he could find it without concerning
himself with the claims of the different centuries; and his specimens
of Lydgate and Hoccleve, Robin Hood Ballads, and trials for Lollardy,
needed as much more added to them to make up a homogeneous volume in
the arrangement now adopted. My additions consist of some Christmas
Carols, a Miracle Play, a Morality, and a number of the interesting
prologues and epilogues of William Caxton; also two extracts on the
art of translation and the need for its exercise, and some depositions
in a theatrical lawsuit. The extracts are of the end of the fourteenth
century, but are germane to our period as heralding the numerous
translations by which it was distinguished; the lawsuit is of the
sixteenth century, but throws light on the transition from municipal
to private enterprise in theatrical matters which had then been for
some time in progress. As these pieces are included for their matter,
not for their style, I hope they will not be considered intrusions in
a volume essentially devoted to the fifteenth century, though the
extracts on translation have led me in my Introduction to an excursus
on the authorship of the Wycliffite translations of the Bible, which
can only be excused on the pleas that Purvey and Trevisa both lived on
into the fifteenth century, and that it was in the early years of that
century that the Bibles were most in circulation.</p>

<p>In editing my texts I have availed myself of the help of the edition
of the play of the Coventry Shearmen and Tailors in Professor Manly's
<i>Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama</i> (Ginn, 1897), of Dr. Henri
Logeman's <i>Elckerlijk and Everyman</i> (Librairie Clemm, Gand, 1892), of
Professor Ewald Fl&uuml;gel's transcript of the Balliol College Carols
published in the Festschrift presented to Professor Hildebrand in
1894, of the Caxton Prefaces printed in Blades's <i>Life of Caxton</i>, of
Mr. Henry Plomer's transcript of the pleadings in Rastell <i>v.</i> Walton
in vol. iv. of the Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, and of
Forshall and Madden's Wyclif Bible. In Professor Arber's text of the
Robin Hood Ballads I have ventured to make a few corrections by the
light of the excellent edition (based on the work of Professor Child),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>printed by Professor Gummere in his <i>Old English Ballads</i> (Ginn,
1894). That of Hoccleve's <i>Letter of Cupid</i>, originally printed from
Urry's text, has been revised with the aid of the collations published
by Professor Skeat in his <i>Chaucerian and Other Pieces</i>. Professor
Arber's other texts are reprinted substantially as they stood.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan adopted throughout the <i>English Garner</i>,
the extracts in this volume are given in modern spelling. I should
have preferred myself to re-write them in the educated spelling of
their own period, which would offer no obstacle of any kind to a
modern reader. Not only, however, for the sake of uniformity, but
because I am so convinced that this is the right method of dealing
with badly spelt texts that I wish the experiment to be made for the
first time by a better philologist than myself, I have fallen back on
modern spelling. Whatever its disadvantages, they seem to me as
nothing compared with the absurdity of preserving in texts printed for
the second, third, and fourth time the vagaries of grossly ignorant
scribes. In the play of the Shearmen holiness is spelt <i>whollenes</i>,
merry <i>myrre</i>, voice <i>woise</i>, signification <i>syngnefocacion</i>,
celestial <i>seylesteall</i>, and so on. These spellings are as
demonstrably wrong as those of <i>consepeet</i> (concipiet) and <i>Gloria in
exselsis</i>, with which the scribe favours us. It is ungracious to find
fault with Professor Manly after appropriating some of his stage
directions and his identifications of some French words, but I cannot
think an editor is right in reprinting a text of which he is obliged
to confess 'in general, the sound will be a better guide to the
meaning than the spelling.' In any case I am sure that this is not the
way to win new readers for our earlier literature.</p>

<p>As a matter of literary honesty, as well as for my own comfort, I may
be permitted to state that this is the only volume of the new edition
of the <i>Garner</i> for which I am responsible or can take credit. I have
eaten at least one dinner intended for my friend Mr. A.F. Pollard; my
wastepaper basket has received applications for subscriptions which
prove his reputation for generosity; I have even received a cheque,
which the fact that it is reckoned forgery under some circumstances
for a man to sign his own name forbade my cashing; and I have recently
been more congratulated as the author of his <i>Henry VIII.</i> than I have
ever been on any book of my own. So far from being identical, I regret
to say that we are not even related; but as we seem to be as much
mistaken as the two Dromios, I hope that our appearance side by side
in this new edition of the <i>Garner</i> may help to distinguish rather
than further confound us.</p>

<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the world of politics and statecraft a nation which has once begun
to decline seldom, perhaps never, recovers itself. There are too many
other dogs about for the bone which has once been relinquished to be
resumed later on. It is luck, indeed, if there are any decent scraps
to be found on the platter when it is revisited. In the world of
literature and thought the dogs are better bred, showing each other
new hunting-grounds, and by example and precept often helping to
restore a famished comrade to sleekness and vigour. Political
conditions may not be gainsaid. A nation which has once lost its
ideals cannot again produce a fresh, strong, and manly literature. But
the possibilities of literature remain immense, and we cannot foretell
in what country it may not revive and win fresh triumphs. Hence it is
that while the political fortunes of a nation seem to move mainly
along the three straight lines of ascent, enjoyment, and fall, its
literary fortunes express themselves, when we try to generalise, in a
series of curves, alternate rises and declines, which may be repeated
again and again. In English literature out of the unknown past rose
the Anglo-Saxon lyric and epic, <i>Deor's Complaint</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, and the
poems of C&aelig;dmon and Cynewulf. From the death-like sleep of our
language which followed the Norman Conquest rose the heights of
thirteenth-century romance. From the dull poetic pedantries of the age
which succeeded Chaucer rose the glittering pinnacles of Shakespeare
and his fellows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> From the coldness and shallowness of the eighteenth
century rose the rich and varied tableland of whose occupants Burns
was one of the first and Tennyson and Browning perhaps the last. No
other literature has shown such recuperative power, a thought full of
hope and consolation in these days, for those who can take pleasure in
the anticipated joys of their great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>If this philosophising be thought dull, we have only repaid popular
estimates in their own coin; for these sweeping generalisations, which
condemn whole centuries as periods of depression, have been largely
made for us by popular opinion, and like all generalisations, they
have to be very considerably whittled down as soon as we descend to
particulars. On a nearer view we find that the curves of literary
progress have not been rolled smooth by any steamroller, but that the
great chain of hills is connected by numberless ridges, some of which
are already rising, long ere others have touched the plain. A pleasant
book by an American professor (the <i>History of Romanticism in the
Eighteenth Century</i>, by Henry A. Beers) has helped to draw attention
to many of these rising ridges of romance in the century which most
people connect only with the name of Pope; and I hope in these few
pages to show that the fifteenth century, of which we are so
contemptuous, was at least not all flat country.</p>

<p>For the poor esteem into which this period has fallen we must lay some
of the blame at the door of the literary historians who have, until
recent days, placed the English Mandeville nearly half a century too
early, postponed the consideration of the dramatic productions till
they reached the middle of the sixteenth century, when they gave a
meagre summary of 'earlier attempts,' and chronicled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> industry of
translators, which had been in full swing ever since about 1380, as a
special feature of the sixteenth century, helping thus to account for
the great Elizabethan outburst of original work. No poor period of
literature was ever more mercilessly or wantonly plundered to enrich
its prosperous neighbours on either side; and having thus credited to
other generations all its little claims to distinction, our literary
historians fixed their glance sternly on the court poetry, which is
its weakest feature, and made the case of Hoccleve and Lydgate more
pitiful than it need be by cruelly comparing them with Chaucer. To be
inconvenient to historians is not perhaps of itself a mark of
greatness, but Chaucer's professed lovers may take pleasure in
observing how largely he shares this characteristic with Shakespeare
himself. To give each of them a separate chapter is but a respectful
subterfuge, thinly concealing how unconscionably these two sudden
elevations interfere with that orderly progression which the historian
loves. It would be much easier to tell the story of the
Elizabethan-Jacobean drama from rise to fall if Shakespeare could be
left out of it; and if there had been no Chaucer, how gentle, how
almost mathematical, would have been the progression from the <i>Cursor
Mundi</i> and the <i>Handlyng Synne</i> to Gower's <i>Confessio Amantis</i>,
from Gower to Lydgate and Hoccleve, and from Lydgate and Hoccleve to
Stephen Hawes! The Italian influence would have come in for the first
time with Surrey and Wyatt, and the whole sequence would have been
just what a plain man would expect. Not only by his inconvenient
possession of genius, but also by his great, if fitful industry, and
by what we can hardly call by any name but good luck, Chaucer shoots
up suddenly between Gower and his natural successors, and thus
revolutionises the standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> of poetry by which the next century is
inevitably judged. The effect of his sudden uprising is almost as
confusing to our judgments of his own poetry as of that of his unhappy
'successors.' Brought up, as most of us poor middle-aged critics have
been, on textbooks which grudgingly devoted a scanty thirty or forty
pages to all that happened ere Surrey and Wyatt began to write an
English which literary historians could read without taking any
trouble, we inevitably got it into our heads that with Chaucer we were
at the very beginning; that he was really, as he was called, the
Father of English Poetry, and represented the first blossoming of its
spring. The spring had come and was fast fading when Chaucer began to
write. It had come with the first blossoming of the romances, and with
such lyrics as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'Lenten<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> is come with love to town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With blossoms and with birdes rown';<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small></span><br />
<br />
or as<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'Blow, northern wind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Send thou me my sweeting';</span></p>

<p>of which the lightness and spontaneity are represented in only a few
snatches in Chaucer. Other touches of the spring he has, for no man
better loved the merry month of May, and he has sung it until he has
become for ever identified with it in our minds. All the same, he
represents also a reaction which sees the humorous side of the lover's
springtide longings, and views all things very much as they are,
without illusion. Fortunately, in Chaucer's case this prosaic mood was
raised and transfigured by the revelation of Italian poetry, which
enabled him to give us in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, and the knight's
tale of <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>the most perfect harmony of humour and
romance English narrative poetry has produced. No other poet of his
time came under the same influences, and to this fact, as well as to
his possession of genius, he owes his unique position.</p>


<p>That the worthy Lydgate and Hoccleve, without any of Chaucer's good
luck, failed to tread in his footsteps, is thus hardly surprising.
They took from him as much of his machinery as they could carry, wrote
in his metres with the aid of ears sadly confused by the rapidly
weakening pronunciation of final <i>-e</i> and <i>-es</i>, and began the
attempt, pursued all through the century, to make up by magniloquence
what they lacked in poetry. This attempt was not confined to England.
In France also there was the same invasion of long words, and it took
our fair neighbour much longer to get rid of them. As the fifteenth
century progressed and its successor began, it became more and more
the object of the poetaster to end his lines with sounding
polysyllables, and verse not written in this style was regarded as
uncourtly and undignified. When we once realise that this particular
experiment in language was one which had to be made, and that our
fifteenth-century poets made it with all their might, we can
understand how Hawes could hail Lydgate as 'the most dulcet spring of
famous rhetoric' (this new poetry being essentially rhetorical); how
Skelton, after condescendingly praising Chaucer for the 'pleasant,
easy and plain' terms in which he wrote, hastened to explain that
Lydgate's efforts were 'after a higher rate'; and how the same Skelton
thought it necessary in his <i>Phylyp Sparowe</i> to make his 'young maid'
excuse herself for her ignorance of 'polished terms' and 'English
words elect.' Every one in these days was searching anxiously for the
right word, which is indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> the most proper object of every
versifier's search. Unluckily, they only looked for it among
polysyllables.</p>

<p>It will be gathered by this time that I hold no brief for what we must
call the court poetry of the fifteenth century, that is to say, the
compositions by which poets from Lydgate to Skelton sought to
ingratiate themselves with noble patrons and to prove their title to
immortality. When they were off their guard they wrote much better.
The reminiscences of the gay days of his youth stirred Hoccleve's muse
to unwonted vivacity. In the <i>London Lick-penny</i> Lydgate, if Lydgate's
it be, wrote humorous satire with success. Skelton himself, though in
his (much too respectfully spoken of) play <i>Magnificence</i> he could
flounder with the worst of his predecessors, in his light and railing
rhymes was nimble enough, and ranged easily from vigorous invective of
Wolsey to pretty panegyrics of fair ladies. Now and again also these
good souls ceased their search for polysyllables, looked at some fair
face or pleasant landscape, and came near to a natural description.
Now and again, too, when they were on their knees (it is only in
prayers intended for other people that long words seem appropriate),
they got down to a phrase of simple beauty. And meanwhile in the
country in general, we may be sure, many simple rhymesters were
keeping up old traditions; and if some diligent student would begin
gleaning from the earlier miscellanies with the industry and insight
by which Mr. A.H. Bullen extracted so rich a harvest from the
Elizabethan song-books, surely he also would not go unrewarded. That
the touch which we find in the religious poems of an earlier date in
the Vernon MS. had not been wholly lost is witnessed by some favourite
lines of mine from a book called <i>Speculum Christiani</i>, printed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Machlinia about 1485, and sometimes attributed to John Wotton&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
'Mary mother, well thou be!<br />
Mary mother, think on me;<br />
Maiden and mother was never none<br />
Together, Lady, save thee alone.<br />
Sweet Lady, maiden clean,<br />
Shield me from ill, shame and teen;<br />
Out of sin, Lady, shield thou me.<br />
And out of debt for charity.<br />
Lady, for thy joy&eacute;s five,<br />
Get me grace in this live,<br />
To know and keep over all thing,<br />
Christian faith and God's bidding.<br />
And truely win all that I need<br />
To me and mine clothe and feed.<br />
Help me, Lady, and all mine;<br />
Shield me, Lady, from hell pine;<br />
Shield me, Lady, from villainy<br />
And from all wicked company.'</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the side of this religious verse is there any need to quote more
than a stanza from the <i>Nut Brown Maid</i> just to remind us what the
secular poets could do?</p>

<div class="poem">
'Be it right or wrong, these men among, on women do complain,<br />
Affirming this, how that it is a labour spent in vain<br />
To love them well; for never a del they love a man again;<br />
For let a man do what he can their favour to attain,<br />
Yet if a new to them pursue their first true lover than<br />
Laboureth for nought and from her thought he is a banished man.'</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To say that English poetry was dead when verse like this was being
written is absurd. It was not dead, but banished from court.</p>

<p>We may well grumble at the mischance which has preserved to us such
quantities of the verse of men like Lydgate and Hawes, with which,
despite all the blandishments of their editors, a not unwise world
refuses to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>cern itself, and on the other hand has permitted to
perish, or scattered seemingly beyond retrieving, the humbler poetry
which has much greater worth. In the Robin Hood Ballads which
Professor Arber has printed from an edition by Wynkyn de Worde we have
at least one piece of salvage. It must be owned, indeed, that to claim
a ballad as the product of any one century is rather rash, and that in
some form or another this cycle was probably in existence before
Chaucer died. The 'Ballad of Otterburn,' again, is founded on an
incident of border war which took place in 1388 when Chaucer had just
begun work on the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, and this also belongs to
fourteenth-century tradition. But both the one and the other, and
still more certainly 'Chevy Chace,' must be reckoned in their present
form to the credit of our period, and form a notable reinforcement to
it, though we must regret that the early transcribers and printers
took so little trouble to preserve a correct text.</p>

<p>Christmas carols again, as likely to be handed down from mouth to
mouth in the same way as ballads, can be assigned neither to any
single author nor to any precise year or even decade of composition.
But the charming examples which I have picked out from a number
transcribed by Professor Fl&uuml;gel from a Balliol College manuscript of
the middle of the sixteenth century, may all safely be attributed to a
date earlier than 1500, though perhaps not very much earlier, and in
their simple tenderness and mirth they are in strong contrast to the
pretentious poetry of the court.<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p>

<p>As with the ballads and carols, so with miracle-plays: the fact that
they were handed down from one generation to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>another, and in each
generation revised, altered, and added to, makes assignment of dates
almost impossible. The play of the Shearmen and Tailors from the
Coventry Gilds cycle,<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> here printed, survived in a transcript dated
1534, and it is probable that it was then copied out for the sake of
combining what must originally have been four or five different plays
into one. Some of these plays in their separate form may have been
first written in the fourteenth century; they appear to have been
added to in the fifteenth, and (as we have seen) assumed their final
form in the sixteenth. The whole of the pseudo-Coventry cycle,<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> in
like manner, seems to have been revised and largely written when it
was last transcribed in 1468. But the supreme example of
fifteenth-century addition to an older cycle is that of the Wakefield
Plays, which early in the century were taken in hand by a dramatist of
extraordinary ability, whose traceable contributions amount to over
three thousand lines, distributed among at least six, or quite
probably as many as nine different plays, of which five are
homogeneous and entirely from his hand. Among these five are the
well-known <i>Prima</i> and <i>Secunda Pastorum</i>, the two Shepherds' Plays
with which the history of English comedy begins. The humours of the
two shepherds who meet on the moor and come to blows over the grazing
of an imaginary flock of sheep are good; the humours of the Secunda
Pastorum, of Mak the sheep-stealer, his clever wife Gyll, the sheep
that was passed off as a baby, and Mak's well-deserved blanketing,&mdash;these
surely are not only good, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>but as good, of their kind, as they well can
be. That I have not printed this second Shepherds' Play here is due
partly to its being easily accessible in the Early English Text
Society's edition, but chiefly to the serious obstacles its northern
dialect presents to any attempt at transcribing it in modern English.
The play of the Shearmen and Tailors of Coventry, on the other hand, as
I have noted in my preface, cries aloud for such transcription. The
fact, moreover, that in its present conglomerate condition, it gives the
whole history of the Divine Infancy from the Annunciation to the Flight
into Egypt makes it very representative, even the humour of the Miracle
Plays being exemplified, though poorly and incongruously, in the attack
of the mothers of the Innocents on Herod's knights. The different
sections of the play, the work no doubt of different authors, have
varying values, that of the Prophets, never very successfully handled,
being much the weakest. On the other hand, in the simple gifts of the
shepherds to the Holy Child we have a very fair representation of one of
the stock incidents of a Nativity Play in which free scope was given to
whatever tender and playful fancy the dramatist possessed. It should be
said that during the fifteenth century the popularity of these plays
increased enormously, records of their performance being found in all
parts of England, including Cornwall and Wales, where they were acted in
the vernacular.</p>

<p>Starting not very much later than the Miracle Plays, since we hear of
them at York in the middle of the fourteenth century, the Moralities
also increased greatly in popularity during our period, offering ample
opportunity for the allegorising and personifying tendency which was
one of its most prominent, and in many respects most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> baneful,
characteristics. Several plays of this kind of undoubted English
origin have come down to us from the fifteenth century itself, and are
well worth study. Chiefly because of the interest which has been
aroused by its recent performance, I have preferred to give that of
<i>The Summoning of Everyman</i>, which, while presenting much less variety
than such plays as <i>The Castle of Perseverance</i>, or <i>Mind, Will, and
Understanding</i>, has the merit of being in very easy English, short,
impressive, and homogeneous. It is these latter merits, quite as much
as the evidence which can be obtained by comparing the two texts, that
offer the best reason for acquiescing in the verdict that the Dutch
play of <i>Elckerlijk</i>, attributed to Petrus Dorlandus, a theological
writer of Diest, who died in 1507, has a better claim than our English
version to be considered the original. Strict adherence to propriety
of form was not a characteristic of the dramatic literature of this
period, and had the play been of native origin its uniform seriousness
of tone would almost assuredly have been broken by some humorous, or

semi-humorous, episodes. While the two plays, with the exception of
the Prologue, which is not found in the Dutch, agree speech by speech
from beginning to end, the English version is not a slavish
translation; indeed, the ease and happiness of the diction, and the
freedom with which it moves, give it, until the Dutch text is
examined, the tone of an original work, and the translator must have
been a man of no small ability to achieve such a success. It should be
said that the oldest Dutch edition now extant appears to have been
printed about 1495; but the play may have been written some years
before this, though hardly as early as 'about 1477,' the date
Professor Logeman proposes, if the author was only born in 1454,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> for
it does not read like the work of a very young man. Professor Logeman
was, perhaps, influenced in proposing this date by a desire to get in
front of the critics of English literature (including ten Brink), who
have assigned the English play to the reign of Edward IV., <i>i.e.</i> not
later than 1483. As in the Miracle Plays, so in the Moralities, an
original purely didactic purpose was gradually influenced by a desire
to render the didacticism more palatable to a popular audience by the
introduction of humorous incidents. The complete absence of these from
<i>Everyman</i> naturally caused critics to assign it the earliest possible
date, so long as it was regarded as an original work. But there is
nothing in the language which precludes it from having been written
immediately after 1495, when we know that a Dutch edition was in
print, and in judging it as a translation we may be content to assign
it to the end of the fifteenth century. It is worth noting that at
that date there must already have been considerable literary
intercourse between England and Holland, and that several popular
English books had already been printed at Antwerp for the English
market.</p>

<p>It would have been pleasant to me, as a lover of these forerunners of
the Elizabethan drama, to have advanced from the Miracle Play and
Morality, and have given examples of the Moral-Interlude and Farce;
but these belong emphatically to the sixteenth century, and come too
near the drama itself for inclusion in a non-dramatic 'Garner.' But as
a counterpart to Professor Arber's Trial of William Thorpe for Heresy,
I have ventured to reprint here from the Transactions of the
Bibliographical Society some pleadings in a theatrical lawsuit of the
reign of Henry VIII., one of the many interesting discoveries
pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>lished by Mr. Henry Plomer. Mr. Plomer's own interest in the
pleadings, and the reason which made them suitable for publication by
a Society in no wise concerned with the history of the drama, arose
from the fact that the plaintiff in the case, John Rastell, besides
being a lawyer and (it is believed) a writer of interludes, was also a
printer, details of any kind that can be gleaned about the lives of
early printers being always welcome to bookish antiquaries. But these
particular details about Rastell's stage in his garden, the classes
from which actors were drawn, the value of the dresses they wore, the
practice of hiring the dresses out, and the rather puzzling
distinction made between stage-plays and interludes,<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small> are all of
considerable interest for our period of the drama, and it seemed a
good deed to give them wider publicity.</p>

<p>We pass now from a survey of its poetry, both non-dramatic and
dramatic, to the work done in the fifteenth century for the
development of English prose. Until quite towards the close of the
fourteenth century England can hardly be said to have possessed any
prose literature not avowedly or practically of a didactic character.
To save some one's soul or to improve some one's morals were seemingly
the only motives which could suffice to persuade an Englishman to
write his native language except in verse. The impulse towards
prose-writing may perhaps be dated from about 1380, the date of the
first Wyclifite translation of the Bible. Of this the books of the Old
Testament, as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>far as Daniel, are stated on contemporary authority to
have been rendered by Nicholas Hereford; while historians, after
salving their conscience by confessing that there is substantially no
evidence for attributing the rest of the work to Wyclif, wherever they
have afterwards to mention it, invariably connect it with his name. A
revised edition, usually assigned to Wyclif's friend, John Purvey, was
completed a few years later. It was about 1380 that Chaucer was
engaged in translating Boethius's <i>De Consolatione Philosophi&aelig;</i>, and
not long afterwards Usk wrote his <i>Testament of Love</i>. The first
really secular English book of any importance, the translation of
Mandeville's <i>Travels</i>, which has come down to us in a Cotton
manuscript, was probably made about the end of the century, and was
quickly succeeded by two variant versions. John of Trevisa, an Oxford
scholar, was the first to English an important historical work, and a
book of popular science, the <i>Polychronicon</i> of Higden and the <i>De
Proprietatibus Rerum</i> of Bartholomew.</p>

<p>It was necessarily by the free use of translation that an English
secular prose literature had to be built up. All the standard works
hitherto had been written in Latin, or in a few cases in French; and
now that English had been recognised, alike at court, in the
law-courts, and in the schools, as the natural language of the
inhabitants of England, the first thing which had to be done was to
provide Englishmen with the ordinary sources of information in their
own language. The need for translation directed attention to its
principles and canons, and two interesting little essays on the
subject are here printed&mdash;the one from the preface, said to be by
Purvey, to the second Wyclifite Bible, and the other from that
prefixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> by Trevisa to his translation of Higden's <i>Polychronicon</i>. I
have particular pleasure in placing these two prefaces side by side,
because, as far as I know, the really striking resemblances between
them, in their grammatical remarks, in their survey of previous
attempts at an English translation of the Bible, and in their attitude
to such a translation, have never been pointed out. Without wishing to
intrude myself into controversial matters on which no one is entitled
to speak who has not made a special study of the subject, I would fain
again draw attention to the fact that whereas we have a definite
statement by Caxton<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> that the <i>Polychronicon</i> 'was englisshed by one
Trevisa, vicarye of barkley, which atte request of one Sir Thomas lord
barkley translated the sayd book [which we have], <i>the byble</i>, and
bartylmew <i>de proprietatibus rerum</i> [which we have] out of latyn into
englysshe,' in the case of Purvey his name was first mentioned in
connection with Bible translation in 1729 by Daniel Waterton, who
'guessed' and 'pitched upon' him (Waterton's Works, vol. x. p. 361) as
the author of the second version, partly on the ground of his general
prominence as a Wyclifite, and also because of his ownership of a
Bible in Trinity College, Dublin, which Waterland hoped would prove to
be of that version. As it happens, the text, which is only that of the
New Testament, is, apparently throughout, that of the earlier version,
with some of the Prologues of the later version to separate books
inserted. Inasmuch also as the manuscript was not completed till 1427
or later, its bearing on the question of the authorship of a
translation, which had then been in circulation for some thirty years,
does not appear to be very great. It was open to any one to combine
the different <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>parts of the two versions in any way he pleased, and
that Purvey seems to have preferred the text of the earlier version
and the prologues of the later hardly proves that the later version is
due to him. If we must drag him in at all, it would be much more
reasonable to assign to him the completion of Nicholas of Hereford's
unfinished work.</p>

<p>Lightly arrived at as it was, Waterland's 'guess' was adopted by
Forshall and Madden in their fine edition of the two versions
published in 1850, and as buttressed up by them with what seems to me
a very weak additional argument, has ever since been repeated as an
established fact.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small> The readiness with which the conjecture was
accepted can only be accounted for by the desire to make the work of
translation centre at Lutterworth instead of, as I believe to have
been the case, at Oxford. It seems to be considered that we shall be
robbing Wyclif of his due unless the translations are connected with
him as closely as possible. Burdened as he was in his last years with
age and infirmities, it is surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> enough if he inspired others to
work at this great task; we need not insist that he must have written
at least part of the first translation with his own hands, and that
the second must have begun under his immediate eye. I would submit,
indeed, that the tone of the second translator's reference to 'the
English Bible late translated' (p. 195) is quite incompatible with any
such theory. We know from the manuscript note in the Bodleian <span class="smcap">ms.</span> that
Nicholas of Hereford began the translation of the Old Testament; and
when his work was interrupted by the necessity for flight, it is far
more likely that it was taken up by some other of Wyclif's numerous
disciples at Oxford rather than by the master himself, while the fact
that it was the work of his disciples, urged no doubt by his wish,
would amply account for such references as may be found to it under
Wyclif's name. For the second translation, it seems to me that the
tone of the reference already quoted, and the detailed account (see p.
194) which the translator gives of the method in which he went to
work, compel us to seek an independent origin, and to look for some
other translator less immediately under Wyclif's influence. The
freedom with which the Bible admittedly circulated for many years, and
the well-known allusion by Sir Thomas More to an English translation
untouched by any taint of heresy, point also in the same direction.
That the second version is really only a revision of the first can
hardly be adduced as a strong argument on the other side. The ethics
of literary acknowledgment were not appreciated in Trevisa's days, and
I believe that a very similar relation can be found on comparison of
what is known as the 'Vulgate' text of Mandeville with that of the
Cotton manuscript, which the second translator appears to have used
freely, though in this case without improving on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> At any rate,
William Caxton seems a better authority than an eighteenth-century
divine as to the authorship of a translation made only a few years
before he was born. We know that Trevisa was what we may call a
professional translator, well equipped for his task; and we find him
in the preface to the <i>Polychronicon</i> discussing the translation of
the Bible in a strikingly similar spirit to that in which it is
discussed in the Prologue to one of the translations which have come
down to us. It is to be hoped that the subject may receive further
investigation, and that without the importation of theological bias.</p>

<p>We meet with the name of John Purvey once more in one of the
longest and most interesting of the pieces here printed, the
Examination of William Thorpe before Archbishop Arundel, held at
Saltwood Castle in Kent in 1407. 'I know none more covetous shrews,'
said the Archbishop to Thorpe in his railing way, 'than ye are when
that ye have a benefice. For, lo! I gave to John Purvey a benefice
(that of West Hythe, which Purvey held for fourteen months from August
1401) but a mile out of this castle, and I heard more complaints about
his covetousness for tithes and other misdoings than I did of all men
that were advanced within my diocese.' 'Sir,' replied Thorpe, 'Sir,
Purvey is neither with you now for the benefice ye gave him, nor
holdeth he faithfully with the learning that he taught and writ
beforetime; and thus he sheweth himself neither to be hot nor cold;
and therefore he and his fellows may sore dread that if they turn not
hastily to the way that they have forsaken, peradventure they be put
out of the number of Christ's chosen people.'</p>

<p>The Archbishop's answer was to mutter threats against Purvey as a
'false harlot'; and so the Bible-translator, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> such he were, was
abused on both sides. The dialogue about him is a fair instance of the
vividness with which Thorpe's account of his trial illustrates the
fortunes of Wyclif's followers when they scattered before their
persecutors without any leader to rally them. Thorpe was accused of
holding all the chief tenets of Wyclif's which were condemned as
contrary to the Church's order and teaching, and his answers,
according to the account he gives of them, were at once bold and
prudent. He seems, moreover, to have had a real gift as a reporter,
and to have exercised it impartially enough, for not every Lollard
would have put into his examiner's mouth that remarkably happy defence
of taking a bagpipe on pilgrimage, which will be found on page 141.
Thorpe, though he was sent back to prison, lived to write this account
of his trial three-and-fifty years after it took place, but Sir John
Oldcastle was burnt alive, despite all Prince Hal's efforts to win him
to recant and save himself, and the short account of his trial, which
follows that of Thorpe, has thus a more tragic interest.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Lollards was but an incident in the fifteenth
century, little affecting its literature, though the burning of
Oldcastle called forth a bad poem by Hoccleve. The wasteful wars in
France, and the turmoil of the Roses, on the other hand, had a great
and most disastrous influence. After Lydgate's death about 1447,
Capgrave was our leading man of letters, and on his death in 1464 the
post was left vacant, unless Master Bennet Burgh can be considered as
having held it. The Paston Letters, which begin in 1422 and cover the
rest of the century (till 1507), offer some consolation for the lack
of more formal literature, but the lack is undeniable. Moreover, not
only literature, but the bookish arts suffered terribly from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
depression. The fine English illuminated manuscripts which at the
beginning of the century had vied with those of France, ceased to be
produced after about 1430 (the siege of Orleans was raised by Jeanne
Darc in 1429, and the synchronism may be significant), and with the
illuminations, the simpler art of penmanship declined also. It was
thus small wonder that the art of printing was introduced but tardily
to our country, more than twenty years after the first printed Bible
had appeared at Mainz, and that, typographically, William Caxton, with
no fine models in contemporary English manuscripts to guide him,
produced no single book that can stand comparison with the best work
of foreign printers. But if he was a poor printer, he was a most
enterprising and skilful publisher, and in his homely way a genuine
and most prolific journeyman of letters. As the word journeyman is
written, shame bids us strike out the first half of it, lest we seem
to cast a slight upon one who did so excellent a work for English
literature, whose enthusiasm was so genuine and whose industry so
great. But Caxton was always modest for himself, and we shall serve
him best by not putting his claims too high. When he commenced author
there is an ingenuity in the way he mixes his constructions, which,
though it may delight his lovers, compels some little caution in
introducing him, haply, to new readers, whom such a paragraph as that
which begins 'When I remember' on page 213 might easily affront. But
he certainly improved his style by constant practice, and the handful
of his prefaces and epilogues here printed do not lack literary charm,
while the information they give of the man, his character, his
enthusiasms, and his business can hardly fail to please any reasonably
sympathetic reader. Take, for instance, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> delightful confidences
as to the fears and hopes attendant on his translation and publication
of that bulky work, the <i>Golden Legend</i> of Jacobus de Voragine, which
might well daunt even an enterprising publisher:&mdash;</p>

<p>'And forasmuch as this said work was great and over chargeable to me
to accomplish, I feared me in the beginning of the translation to have
continued it, because of the long time of the translation and also in
the imprinting of the same, and in manner half desperate to have
accomplished it, was in purpose to have left it, after that I had
begun to translate it, and to have laid it apart, ne had it been at
the instance and request of the puissant, noble and virtuous Earl, my
Lord William Earl of Arundel, which desired me to proceed and continue
the said work, and promised me to take a reasonable quantity of them
when they were achieved and accomplished, and sent to me a worshipful
gentleman, a servant of his named John Stanney, which solicited me in
my lord's name that I should in no wise leave it, but accomplish it,
promising that my said lord should during his life give and grant to
me a yearly fee, that is to wit a buck in summer and a doe in winter,
with which fee I hold me well content. Then at the contemplation and
reverence of my said lord I have endeavoured me to make an end and
finish this said translation and also have imprinted it in the most
best wise that I have, could or might, and present this said book to
his good and noble lordship, as chief causer of the achieving of it,
praying him to take it in gree of me William Caxton, his poor servant,
and that it like him to remember my fee, and I shall pray unto
Almighty God for his long life and welfare, and after this short and
transitory life to come into everlasting joy in heaven, the which he
send to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> him and to me and unto all them that shall read and hear this
said book, that for the love and faith of whom all these holy saints
hath suffered death and passion. Amen.'</p>

<p>Few publishers since Caxton's days have let us so far into their
secrets, and we can but hope that his patron really took 'a reasonable
quantity' of the edition (another was published in a few years, so he
probably did), and that the bucks and the does furnished many jolly
dinners. Elsewhere in these prefaces Caxton tells us how he was
induced to take up the art of printing, narrates the trouble, in which
he has had successors, in getting a good text of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, pokes fun at English ladies and at another of his patrons, the
Earl of Rivers, and sets down what is still one of the best criticisms
ever penned of Malory's <i>King Arthur</i>. With the mention of that noble
work it is well to finish this brief sketch of our fifteenth-century
literature. It is too well known, too easily accessible, for any
snippets to be quoted from it here. But with the English version of
Mandeville at the beginning of our period, and Malory's <i>Arthur</i>
completed in 1469 and published in 1483, it is evident that we can lay
claim to two masterpieces which have not yet lost their hold on modern
readers. The simplicity and feeling of <i>Everyman</i> has lately obtained
recognition. I hope that, when boys and girls are taught a little more
of their own language, the play of <i>Max the Sheepstealer</i> may win even
greater popularity, for it is an ideal play for children to act. If we
throw in 'Chevy Chace' and the 'Nut Brown Maid' and the 'Robin Hood
Ballads,' we shall not be lacking for poetry. For the interest which
we now seek in a realistic novel we might well go to the Paston
Letters. There are not a few nations of Europe which might be well
pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> if they could show, century by century, as good a record as
this. It is only in fact the ill-fortune which placed it midway
between Chaucer and Shakespeare, and our own perversity which persists
in associating it mainly with Lydgate and Hoccleve, that causes us to
contemn this particular century as dull.</p>

<i>Ecclesi&aelig; Regimen</i> (the instances quoted seem to me resemblances
merely of topics, and these not uncommon ones).</p>

<p>(iii) The <i>Ecclesi&aelig; Regimen</i> resembles Purvey's confession at his
recantation in 1400 (the previous criticism applies here much more
strongly).</p></div>

<p>Therefore the translation of the Bible is by the author of the
<i>Ecclesi&aelig; Regimen</i>, and the author of this is Purvey. I must repeat
that the chain seems to me lamentably weak, and that the resemblances
which may be found between Section xv. of the Prologue and Trevisa's
Dialogue and Letter to Lord Berkeley are stronger, because not arising
out of quite such common topics. That they are only to a slight extent
verbal resemblances is no drawback. We do not expect a man to repeat
his own words exactly. What is interesting is to find two translators
both interested in their own methods, and these methods similar.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><img src="images/gflower.png" style="margin-bottom: .5em;" alt="G" /></span>od, that all this world did make<br />
And died for us upon a tree,<br />
Save England, for <span class="smcap">Mary</span> thy Mother's sake!<br />
As Thou art steadfast GOD in Trinity.<br />
And save King <span class="smcap">Henry's</span> soul, I beseech thee!<br />
That was full gracious and good withal;<br />
A courteous Knight and King royal.<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the Fifth, noble man of war,<br />
Thy deeds may never forgotten be!<br />
Of Knighthood thou wert the very Loadstar!<br />
In thy time England flowered in prosperity,<br />
Thou mortal Mirror of all Chivalry!<br />
Though thou be not set among the Worthies Nine;<br />
Yet wast thou a Conqueror in thy time!<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Dauphin's offer of tennis balls.</span></div><br />
Our King sent into France full rath,<br />
His Herald that was good and sure.<br />
He desired his heritage for to have:<br />
That is Gascony and Guienne and Normandy.<br />
He bade the Dolphin [<i>Dauphin</i>] deliver. It should be his:<br />
All that belonged to the first <span class="smcap">Edward</span><br />
"And if he say me, Nay!; iwis<br />
I will get it with dint of sword!"<br />
But then answered the Dolphin bold,<br />
By our ambassadors sending again,<br />
"Methinks that your King is not so old,<br />
Wars great for to maintain.<br />
Greet well," he said, "your comely King<br />
That is both gentle and small;<br />
A ton full of tennis balls I will him send,<br />
For to play him therewithal."<br />
<br />
Then bethought our Lords all,<br />
In France they would no longer abide:<br />
They took their leave both great and small,<br />
And home to England gan they ride.<br />
To our King they told their tale to the end;<br />
What that the Dolphin did to them say.<br />
"I will him thank," then said the King,<br />
"By the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, if I may!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Yet, by his own mind, this Dolphin bold,<br />
To our King he sent again hastily;<br />
And prayed him truce for to hold,<br />
For <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>' love that died on a tree.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">King Henry will go to France.</span></div>
"Nay," then said our comely King,<br />
"For into France will I wind!<br />
The Dolphin anger I trust I shall:<br />
And such a tennis ball I shall him send,<br />
That shall bear down the high roof of his hall."<br />
<br />
The King at Westminster lay that time,<br />
And all his Lords everych one;<br />
And they did set them down to dine:<br />
"Lordings," he saith, "by St. John!<br />
To France I think to take my way:<br />
Of good counsel I you pray,<br />
What is your will that I shall do?<br />
Shew me shortly without delay!"<br />
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Clarence</span> answered soon,<br />
And said, "My Liege, I counsel you so!"<br />
And other Lords said, "We think it for the best<br />
With you to be ready for to go;<br />
Whiles that our lives may endure and last."<br />
<br />
"Grammercy, Sirs!" the King gan say,<br />
"Our right, I trust, then shall be won,<br />
And I will 'quite you if I may:<br />
Therefore I warn you, both old and young,<br />
To make you ready without delay<br />
To Southampton to take your way<br />
At St. Peter's tide at Lammas;<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small><br />
For by the grace of <span class="smcap">GOD</span>, and if I may,<br />
Over the salt sea I think to pass!"<br />
<br />
Great ordnance of guns the King let make,<br />
And shipped them at London all at once;<br />
Bows and arrows in chests were take,<br />
Spears and bills with iron gunstones,<br />
And arming daggers made for the nonce:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
With swords and bucklers that were full sure.<br />
And harness bright that strokes would endure.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The English arrive in Normandy.</span></div>
The King to Southampton then did ride<br />
With his Lords; for no longer would he dwell.<br />
Fifteen hundred fair ships there did him abide,<br />
With good sails and top-castle.<br />
Lords of France our King they sold<br />
For a million of gold as I heard say.<br />
By England little price they told,<br />
Therefore their song was "Well a way!"<br />
<br />
Between Hampton and the Isle of Wight,<br />
These goodly ships lay there at road,<br />
With mastyards across, full seemly of sight,<br />
Over the haven spread abroad:<br />
On every pavis [<i>target</i>] a cross red;<br />
The waists decked with serpentines [<i>cannon</i>] strong.<br />
St George's streamers spread overhead,<br />
With the Arms of England hanging all along.<br />
<br />
Our King fully hastily to his ship yede,<br />
And all other Lords of every degree:<br />
Every ship weighed his anchor in deed,<br />
With the tide to haste them to the sea.<br />
They hoisted their sails, sailed aloft:<br />
A goodly sight it was to see.<br />
The wind was good, and blew but soft:<br />
And forth they went in the name of the Trinity.<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small><br />
<br />
Their course they took toward Normandy,<br />
And passed over in a day and a night.<br />
So in the second morning early,<br />
Of that country they had a sight:<br />
And ever [as] they drew near the coast,<br />
Of the day glad were they all;<br />
And when they were at the shore almost,<br />
Every ship his anchor let fall,<br />
With their tackles they launched many a long boat<br />
And over ha[t]ch threw them into the stream;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
A thousand shortly they saw afloat.<br />
With men of arms that light did leme.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The guns play tennis with Harfleur.</span></div>
Our king landed at Cottaunses [<i>Coutances</i>] without delay,<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small><br />
On our Lady's Even [of] the Assumption;<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small><br />
And to Harflete [<i>Harfleur</i>] they took the way<br />
And mustered fair before the town.<br />
Our King his banner there did 'splay,<br />
With standards bright and many [a] pennon:<br />
And there he pitched his tent adown;<br />
Full well broidered with armory gay.<br />
First our comely King's tent with the crown,<br />
And all other Lords in good array.<br />
<br />
"My brother <span class="smcap">Clarence</span>," the King did say,<br />
"The towers of the town will I keep<br />
With her daughters and her maidens gay,<br />
To wake the Frenchmen of their sleep."<br />
"'London'," he said, "shall with him meet;<br />
And my guns that lieth fair upon the green;<br />
For they shall play with Harflete<br />
A game of tennis as I ween.<br />
Go we to game, for God's grace!<br />
My children be ready everych one."<br />
<br />
For every great gun that there was,<br />
In his mouth he had a stone.<br />
The Captain of Harflete soon anon<br />
Unto our King he sent hastily<br />
To know what his will was to be done,<br />
For to come thither with such a meiny?<br />
"Deliver me the town!" the King said.<br />
"Nay!" said the Captain, "by God and St <span class="smcap">Denis</span>!"<br />
"Then shall I win it," said our King,<br />
"By the grace of GOD and his goodness,<br />
Some hard tennis balls I have hither brought<br />
Of marble and iron made full round.<br />
I swear, by <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> that me dear bought,<br />
They shall beat the walls to the ground."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">King Henry grants a Truce.</span></div>
Then said the great gun,<br />
"Hold fellows, we go to game!"<br />
Thanked be <span class="smcap">Mary</span> and <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> her son,<br />
They did the Frenchmen much shame.<br />
"Fifteen afore," said "London" then;<br />
Her balls full fair she gan outthrow.<br />
"Thirty" said the second gun, "I will win and I may."<br />
There as the wall was most sure,<br />
They bare it down without nay.<br />
The "King's Daughter" said "Hearken this play!<br />
Hearken Maidens now this tide!<br />
Five and forty we have, it is no nay."<br />
They beat down the walls on every side.<br />
<br />
The Normands said, "Let us not abide!<br />
But go we in haste, by one assent!<br />
Wheresoever the gunstones do glide,<br />
Our houses in Harfleet are all to rent:<br />
The Englishmen our bulwarks have brent"<br />
And women cried, "Alas that ever they were born!"<br />
The Frenchmen said, "Now be we shent!<br />
By us now the town is forlorn:<br />
It is best now therefore<br />
That we beseech this English King of grace,<br />
For to assail us no more;<br />
Lest he destroy us in this place.<br />
Then will we bid the Dolphin make him ready,<br />
Or else this town delivered must be."<br />
<br />
Messengers went forth by and bye,<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small><br />
And to our King came they:<br />
The Lord <span class="smcap">Corgraunt</span> certainly,<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small><br />
For he was Captain of the place,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Gelam Bowser</span> with him did hie,<br />
With other Lords more and less.<br />
And when they to our King come where,<br />
Full lowly set them on their knee:<br />
"Hail, comely King!" gan they say<br />
"<span class="smcap">Christ</span> save thee from adversity!<br />
Of truce we will beseech thee<br />
Until that it be Sunday noon:<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
And if we may not recovered be,<br />
We will deliver the town."<br />
<br />
Then said our King full soon,<br />
"I grant you grace in this tide;<br />
One of you shall forth anon,<br />
And the remnant shall with me abide!"<br />
Their Captain took his next way,<br />
And to Rouen fast gan he ride.<br />
The Dolphin he had thought there to find<br />
But he was gone; he durst not abide.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The French surrender Harfleur.</span></div>
For help the Captain besought that tide<br />
"Harflete is lost for ever and aye;<br />
The walls be beaten down on every side,<br />
That we no longer keep it may."<br />
Of counsel all he did them pray.<br />
"What is your will that I may do?<br />
We must ordain the King battle by Sunday,<br />
Or else deliver him the town!"<br />
The Lords of Rouen together did rown;<br />
And bade the town should openly yield.<br />
The King of England fareth as a lion:<br />
We will not meet with him in the field!<br />
The Captain would then no longer abide,<br />
And towards Harflete came he right;<br />
For so fast did he ride<br />
That he was there the same night.<br />
<br />
And when he to our King did come,<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small><br />
Lowly he set him on his knee:<br />
"Hail, comely Prince!" then did he say,<br />
"The grace of GOD is with thee!<br />
Here have I brought the keys all<br />
Of Harflete that is so royal a city.<br />
All is yours, both chamber and hall;<br />
And at your will for to be."<br />
<br />
"Thanked be <span class="smcap">Jesu</span>!" said our King,<br />
"And <span class="smcap">Mary</span> his mother truly!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<div class="sidenote">21,000 <span class="smcap">French sent out of Harfleur</span>.</div>
My uncle <span class="smcap">Dorset</span>, without letting,<br />
Captain of Harflete shall he be.<br />
And all that is within the city<br />
Awhile yet they shall abide,<br />
To amend the walls in every degree<br />
That are beaten down on every side:<br />
And after that, they shall out ride<br />
To other towns over all.<br />
Wife nor child shall not there abide:<br />
But have them forth, both great and small!"<br />
One and twenty thousand, men might see,<br />
When they went out, full sore did weep.<br />
<br />
The great guns and ordnance truly<br />
Were brought into Harflete.<br />
<br />
Great sickness among our host was, in good fay,<br />
Which killed many of our Englishmen:<br />
There died beyond seven score upon a day;<br />
Alive there was left but thousands ten.<br />
<br />
Our King himself into the Castle yede,<br />
And rest him there as long as his will was:<br />
At the last he said, "Lords, so God me speed!<br />
Towards Calais I think to pass."<br />
<br />
After that Harflete was gotten, that royal city,<br />
Through the grace of GOD omnipotent;<br />
Our comely King made him ready soon,<br />
And towards Calais forth he went.<br />
"My brother <span class="smcap">Gloucester</span> <i>veramente</i><br />
Here will we no longer abide!<br />
And Cousin of <span class="smcap">York</span>, this is our intent:<br />
With us forth ye shall, this tide!<br />
My Cousin <span class="smcap">Huntingdon</span> with us shall ride;<br />
And the Earl of <span class="smcap">Oxenford</span> with you three!<br />
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Southfolk</span> [<i><span class="smcap">Suffolk</span></i>] by our side<br />
He shall come forth with his meiny!<br />
And the Earl of <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span> sikerly!<br />

Sir <span class="smcap">William Bowser</span><small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small>, that will not fail;<br />
For all they will help, if it be need."<br />
<br />
Our King rode forth, blessed might he be!<small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small><br />
He spared neither dale nor down;<br />
By waters great fast rode he,<br />
Till he came to the water of Seine.<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small><br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Englishmen to be sold six for a penny.</span></div>
The Frenchmen threw the bridge adown<br />
That over the water they might not pass.<br />
Our King made him ready then;<br />
And to the town of Turreyn went more and less.<br />
The Frenchmen, our King about becast<br />
With Battles strong on every side;<br />
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Orleans</span> said in haste<br />
"The King of England shall abide.<br />
Who gave him leave this way to pass?<br />
I trust that I shall him beguile<br />
Full long ere he come to Calais."<br />
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Bourbon</span> answered soon<br />
And swore by God and by St. <span class="smcap">Denis</span><br />
"We will play them every each one,<br />
These Lords of England at the tennis;<br />
Their gentlemen, I swear by St. <span class="smcap">John</span>!<br />
And archers we will sell them great plenty:<br />
And so will we rid [of] them soon,<br />
Six for a penny of our money."<br />
Then answered the Duke of <span class="smcap">Bar</span>,<br />
Words that were of great pride:<br />
"By God!" he said, "I will not spare<br />
Over all the Englishmen for to ride,<br />
If that they dare us abide:<br />
We will overthrow them in fere [<i>company</i>],<br />
And take them prisoners in this tide:<br />
Then come home again to our dinner!"<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Henry</span> our King that was so good;<br />
He prepared there full royally:<br />
Stakes he let [<i>caused to</i>] hew in a wood,<br />
And then set them before his archers verily.<br />
The Frenchmen our ordnance gan espy.<br />
They that we ordained for to ride<br />
Lighted adown, with sorrow truly;<br />
So on their feet fast gan abide.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The famous Battle of Agincourt.</span></div>
Our King went up upon a hill high<br />
And looked down to the valleys low:<br />
He saw where the Frenchmen came hastily<br />
As thick as ever did hail or snow.<br />
Then kneeled our King down, in that stound,<br />
And all his men on every side:<br />
Every man made a cross and kissed the ground,<br />
And on their feet fast gan abide.<br />
Our King said, "Sirs, what time of the day?"<br />
"My Liege," they said, "it is nigh Prime [9 <i>a.m.</i>]"<br />
"Then go we to our journey,<br />
By the grace of <span class="smcap">Jesu</span>, it is good time:<br />
For saints that lie in their shrine,<br />
To GOD for us be praying.<br />
All the Religious of England, in this time,<br />
<i>Ora pro nobis</i> for us they sing."<br />
<br />
St. <span class="smcap">George</span> was seen over the host:<br />
Of very truth this sight men did see.<br />
Down was he sent by the HOLY GHOST,<br />
To give our King the victory.<br />
<br />
Then blew the trumpets merrily,<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small><br />
These two Battles [<i>Armies</i>] together yede.<br />
Our archers stood up full heartily,<br />
And made the Frenchmen fast to bleed.<br />
Their arrows went fast, without any let,<br />
And many shot they throughout;<br />
Through habergeon, breastplate, and bassinet.<br />
An eleven thousand were slain in that rout.<br />

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">King Henry's Triumph in London</span>.</div>
Our gracious King, as I well know,<br />
That day he fought with his own hand.<br />
He spared neither high ne low.<br />
There was never King in no land,<br />
That ever did better on a day.<br />
Wherefore England may sing a song:<br />
<i>Laus DEO!</i> may we say;<br />
And other prayers ever among.<br />
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Orleans</span>, without nay,<br />

<br />
Lo, thus our comely King conquered the field,<br />
By the grace of God omnipotent,<br />
He took his prisoners, both old and young,<br />
And towards Calais forth he went.<br />
<br />
He shipped there with good intent:<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small><br />
To Canterbury full fair he passed,<br />
And offered to St. <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>'s shrine.<br />

To Eltham he came all in good time.<small><a name="f24.1" id="f24.1" href="#f24">[24]</a></small><br />
And over Blackheath, as he was riding,<small><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></small><br />
Of the city of London he was ware.<br />
"Hail, royal city!" said our King,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Christ</span> keep thee ever from sorrow and care!"<br />
And then he gave that noble city his blessing<br />
He prayed <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> it might well fare!<br />
To Westminster did he ride,<br />
And the French prisoners with him also:<br />
He ransomed them in that tide,<br />
And again to their country he let them go.<br />
<br />
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Lamentable Siege of Rouen</span>.</div>
Thus of this matter I make an end,<br />
To th'effect of the Battle have I gone:<br />
For in this book I cannot comprehend<br />
The greatest battle of all, called the Siege of Rouen.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
For that Siege lasted three years and more,<br />
And there a rat was at forty pence<br />
For in the city the people hungered sore.<br />
Women and children, for fault of meat, were lore;<br />
And some for pain bare bones were gnawing,<br />
That at their breasts had two children sucking.<br />
<br />
Of the Siege of Rouen it to write were pity,<br />
It is a thing so lamentable:<br />
Yet every High Feast, our King, of his charity,<br />
Gave them meat to their bodies comfortable;<br />
And at the last the town won, without fable.<br />
<br />
Thus of all as now I make an end:<br />
To the bliss of heaven, GOD our souls send!</div>

<br />
In general, we wollen that ye know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Ladies of honour and reverence,</span><br />
And other Gentlewomen havin sow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such seed of complaint in our audience,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of men that do them outrage and offence;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That it our earis grieveth for to hear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So piteous is the effect of this matere.</span><br />
<br />
Passing all landis, on the little isle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That cleped is Albion, they most complain,</span><br />
They say that there is crop and root of guile:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So can those men dissimulen and feign,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With standing dropis in their eyen twain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When that their heartis feeleth no distress,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To blinden women with their doubleness.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><br />
Their wordis, spoken be so sighingly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With so piteous a cheer and countenance</span><br />
That every wight that meaneth tru&egrave;ly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deemeth that they in heart have such grievance.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They say, "So importable is their penance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That but their lady lust to shew them grace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They, right anon, must starven in the place."</span><br />
<br />
"Ah, Lady mine!" they say, "I you ensure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As doth me grace! and I shall ever be,</span><br />
While that my life may laste and endure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To you as humble and low in each degree</span><br />

Full hard it is, to know a manis heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For outward may no man the truth&egrave; deem,</span><br />
When word out of his mouth may none astert<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it by reason seemed a wight to queme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So it is said of heart, as it would seem.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O faithful woman! full of innocence!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou art deceiv&egrave;d by false appearance!</span><br />
<br />
By process moveth oft woman's pity.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weening all things were as these men ysay,</span><br />
They grant them grace, of their benignity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that men shoulden not, for their sake die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with good hearte, set them in the way</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of blissful lov&eacute;: keep it, if they con!</span><br />

And when this man the pan hath by the steel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fully is in his possession;</span><br />
With that woman keepeth he no more to deal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After, if he may finden in the town</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Any woman, his blind affection</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On to bestow. But evil mote he preve!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A man, for all his oaths, is hard to believe!</span><br />
<br />
And for that every false Man hath a Make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As unto every wight is light to know)</span><br />
When this traitor, this woman hath forsake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He fast him speedeth unto his fellow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he be there, his heart is on a low;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His false deceit ne may him not suffice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But of his treason telleth all the wise.</span><br />
<br />
Is this a fair avaunt? Is this honour?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A man himself accuse thus and defame!</span><br />
Is it good to confess himself a traitor?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bring a woman into slanderous name</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tell how he her body hath do shame?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No worship may he thus, to him conquer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But great dislander unto him and her!</span><br />
<br />
To her! Nay! Yet ywas it no reprefe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For all for virtue was, that she ywrought!</span><br />
But he that brew&egrave;d hath all this mischief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That spake so fair, and falsely inward thought;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His be the slander! as it by reason ought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And unto her be thank perpetual</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, in such a neede helpen can so well.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br />
Although through manis sleight and subtilty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A silly simple and innocent woman</span><br />
Betrayed is: no wonder! since the city<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Troy, as that the story tellen can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betray&egrave;d was, through the deceit of man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And set on fire, and all down overthrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And finally destroy&egrave;d, as men know.</span><br />
<br />
Betrayen not men cities great and kings?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What wight is it that can shape remedy</span><br />
Against these falsely propos&egrave;d things?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who can the craft such craft&eacute;s to espy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But man? whose wit is e'er ready to apply</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To thing that sowning is into falshede?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Woman! beth'ware of false men! I thee rede.</span><br />
<br />
And, furthermore, have these men in usage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That where they not likely been to sped,</span><br />
Such as they been with a double visage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They procuren, for to pursue their need;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He prayeth him, in his caus&eacute; to proceed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And largely guerdoneth he his travail.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Little wot women, how men them assail!</span><br />
<br />
Another wretch, unto his fellow saith,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou fishest fair! She which that thee hath fired</span><br />
Is false, inconstant, and she hath no faith.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She for the road of folk is so desired;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, as an horse, from day to day she is hired!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That when thou twinnest from her company,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cometh another; and bleared is thine eye!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
Now prick on faste! and ride thy journey<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thou art there! For she, behind thy back,</span><br />
So liberal is, she will nothing withsay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But smartly of another take a smack.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus faren these women all the pack</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whoso them trusteth, hanged mote he be!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ever they desire change and novelty."</span><br />
<br />
Whereof proceedeth this, but of envy?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that he himselve her ne winnen may.</span><br />
He speaketh her reprefe and villainy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As manis blabbing tongue is wont alway.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus divers men full often make assay.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For to disturben folk in sundry wise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For they may not acheven their emprise.</span><br />
<br />
Many one eke would speaken for no good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hath in love his tim&egrave; spent and used.</span><br />
Men wist, his Lady his asking withstood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere that he were of her, plainly refused.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or waste and vain were all that he had mused:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherefore he can none other remedy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But on his Lady shapeth him to lie.</span><br />
<br />
"Every woman," he saith, "is light to get,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can none say, 'Nay!' if she be well ysought;</span><br />
Whoso may leisure have with her to treat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his purpose ne shall be failen ought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he on madness be so deep ybrought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That he shende all with open homeliness;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That loven women not, as that I guess."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><br />
To slaunder women thus, what may profit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To gentles? namely, that them armen should,</span><br />
And in defence of women them delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As that the Order of Gentilesse would?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If that a man list gentle to be held</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He must all flee that thereto is contrary.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A slanderous tongue is his great adversary!</span><br />
<br />
A foul vice is of tongue to be light.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For <i>whoso mochil clappeth, gabbeth oft</i>.</span><br />
The Tongue of Man so swift is, and so wight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That when it is yrais&egrave;d up on loft,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reason it sueth so slowly and soft,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That it him never overtaken may.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lord! so these men been trusty in assay!</span><br />
<br />
Albeit that men find one woman nice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inconstant, recheless, and variable,</span><br />
Deignous and proud, full fill&egrave;d of malice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withouten faith or love, and deceivable,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sly, quaint, false, in all untrust culpable,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wicked or fierce, or full of cruelty:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet followeth not that such all women be!</span><br />
<br />
When the high God angellis form&egrave;d had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among them alle formed were there none</span><br />
That founden were malicious and bad?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes! all men wot that there were many one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That for their prid&eacute; fell from heaven anon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Should we, forthy, give all angels proud name?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, he that that sustaineth, is to blame!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br />
Of twelve Apostles, one a traitor was;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The remenant yet good weren and true.</span><br />
So if it happen men finden, percase,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A woman false; such good is to eschew:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deem&eacute; not that they be all untrue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I see well, that men's own&eacute; falseness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Them causeth woman for to trust the less.</span><br />
<br />
O, every man ought have a heart&eacute; tender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unto woman, and deem her honourable;</span><br />
Whether her shape be thick, or else slender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or she be good or bad! It is no fable.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every wight wot, that wit hath reasonable,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That of a woman, he descend&egrave;d is:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then is it shame of her to speak amiss!</span><br />
<br />
A wicked tree good fruit may none forth bring;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For such the fruit is aye as is the tree.</span><br />
Take heed of whom thou took thy beginning!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let thy mother be mirror unto thee!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Honour her, if thou wilt honoured be!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Despiseth her then not, in no manere!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest that thereby thy wickedness appear.</span><br />
<br />
An old proverb there said is, in English,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>That bird or fowl, soothly, is dishonest</i></span><br />
<i>What that he be, and holden full churlish</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>That useth to defoulen his own nest</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Men to say well of women, it is the best:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And naught for to despise them, ne deprave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If that they will their honour keep or save.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br />
The Ladies ever complainen them on Clerks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they have made bookis of their defame;</span><br />
In which they despise women and their works,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And speaken of them great reproof and shame:</span><br />
And caus&egrave;less give them a wicked name.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus they despis&egrave;d be, on every side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dislander&egrave;d and blown upon full wide.</span><br />
<br />
Those sorry bookes maken mention<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How women betrayed in especial</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>, <span class="smcap">David</span>, <span class="smcap">Sampson</span>, and <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many one more; who may rehearse them all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The treasons that they hav&eacute; done, and shall?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The world their malice may not comprehend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(As Clerkis feign), for it ne hath none end.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Ovid</span>, in his book called <i>Remedy</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Of Lov&egrave;</i>, great reproof of woman writeth,</span><br />
Wherein, I know that he did great folly;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every wight who, in such case, him delighteth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Clerkis custom is, when he enditeth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of women (be it prose, or rhyme, or verse)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Say, "They be wicked!" all know he the reverse.</span><br />
<br />
And the book Scholars learned in their childhead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they of women beware should in age,</span><br />
And for to love them ever be in dread.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sith to deceive is set all their courage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They say peril to cast is advantage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Namely, of such as men have in been wrapped:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For many a man, by woman hath mishapped.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
No charge is what so that these Clerkis sain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all their writing I ne do no cure</span><br />
All their labour and travail is in vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For between me and my Lady Nature</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall not be suffred, while the world may 'dure.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus these Clerkis, by their cruel tyranny,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On silly women kithen their mastery.</span><br />
<br />
Whilom full many of them were in my chain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ytied; and now, what for unwieldy age</span><br />
And unlust, they may not to love attain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sain that "Love is but very dotage!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus, for that they themself lacken courage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They folk exciten by their wicked saws</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For to rebell against me, and my laws!</span><br />
<br />
But, maugre them that blamen women most,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such is the force of mine impression</span><br />
That, suddenly, I can fell all their boast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all their wrong imagination.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shall not be in their election</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The foulest slut in all the town to refuse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If that me list, for all that they can muse:</span><br />
<br />
But her in heart as brenningly desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As though she were a Duchess, or a Queen;</span><br />
So can I folkis heartis set on fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, as me list, them senden joy or teen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They that to women ben ywhet so keen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My sharp&egrave; piercing strokis, how they smite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall feel and know, and how they kerve and bite!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br />
Pardie! this Clerk, this subtle sly <span class="smcap">Ovid</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many another have deceived be</span><br />
Of women, as it knowen is full wide.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What! no men more! and that is great dainty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So excellent a Clerk as was he!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And other more, that coulde full well preach</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Betrapped were, for aught that they could teach!</span><br />
<br />
And trusteth well, that it is no marvail!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For women knowen plainly their intent.</span><br />
They wist how softily they could assail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Them; and what falsehood they in heart&egrave; meant:</span><br />
And thus they Clerkis in their danger hent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With one venom, another is destroyed!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And thus these Clerkis often were annoyed.</span><br />
<br />
These Ladies, ne these gentles ne'ertheless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where none of those that wroughten in this wise;</span><br />
But such women as weren vertueless<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They quittin thus these old Clerkis wise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Clerkis muchil less ought to suffice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than to dispraven women generally;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For worship shall they geten noon thereby.</span><br />
<br />
If that these men, that lovers them pretend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To women weren faithful, good, and true,</span><br />
And dread them to deceive, or to offend;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Women, to love them would&eacute; not eschew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, every day hath man an hart&eacute; new!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It upon one abiden can no while.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lightly, and withouten any pain</span><br />
They wonnen be; they can no wight withstand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That his disease list to them to complain!</span><br />

To Master <span class="smcap">Jean de Meun</span>, as I suppose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, it is a lewd occupation,</span><br />
In making of the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So many a sly imagination,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And perils for to rollen up and down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So long process, so many a sly cautel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For to deceive a silly damosel!</span><br />
<br />
Nought can I see, ne my wit comprehend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That art, and pain, and subtilty should fail</span><br />
For to conquer, and soon to make an end;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When men a feeble plac&eacute; shall assail:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon, also, to vanquish a battle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of which no wight shall maken resistance;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ne heart hath none to stonden at defence.</span><br />
<br />
Then mote it follow, of necessity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sith art asketh so great engine and pain</span><br />
A woman to deceive, what so she be?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of constancy be they not so barren</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As that some of these subtle Clerkis feign;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But they be, as that women oughten be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sad, constant, and fulfilled of pity.</span><br />

Ne oppress people, ne them overlead,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fervent Will, and Entalented Courage,</span><br />
All thewis good, as sitteth well to be,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And well they can a manis ire assuage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With soft&egrave; wordis, discreet and benign.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What they be inward, they show outward by sign.</span><br />
<br />
Womanis heart unto no cruelty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclined is; but they be Charitable,</span><br />
Piteous, Devout, Full of Humility,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shamefast&egrave;, Debonaire, and Amiable,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dread full, and of their wordis measurable:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What women, these have not, peradventure;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Followeth not the way of her nature.</span><br />
<br />
Men sayen that our First Mother na'theless<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made all mankinde lose his liberty,</span><br />
And nakid it of joy&egrave;, doubteless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Godis hest&egrave;s disobeyed she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she presumed to taste of the tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That God forbade that she eat thereof should.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And ne had the Devil be, no more she would!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><br />
The envious swelling, that the Fiend our foe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had unto man in heart&egrave;, for his wealth,</span><br />
Sent a serpent, and made her for to go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To deceive <span class="smcap">Eve</span>; and thus was manis health</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bereft him by the Fiend, right in a stealth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The woman not knowing of the deceit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God wot! Full far was it from her conceit!</span><br />
<br />
Wherefore I say, that this good woman <span class="smcap">Eve</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our father <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, ne deceived nought.</span><br />
There may no man for a deceit it preve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Properly, but if that she, in heart and thought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had it compassed first, ere she it wrought.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And for such was not her impression,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Men may it call no Deceit, by reason.</span><br />
<br />
Ne no wight deceiveth, but he purpose!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fiend this deceit cast, and nothing she.</span><br />
Then it is wrong to deemen or suppose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That of this harm she should the caus&egrave; be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wytith the Fiend, and his be the maugree!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all excus&egrave;d have her innocence,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save only, that she brake obedience!</span><br />
<br />
And touching this, full few&egrave; men there be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unnethis any, dare I safely say!</span><br />
From day to day, as men may all day see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But that the hest of God they disobey.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have this in mind&egrave;, siris! I you pray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If that ye be discreet and reasonable;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ye will her hold&egrave; the more excusable!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><br />
And where men say, "In man is stedfastness;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And woman is of her courage unstable."</span><br />
Who may of <span class="smcap">Adam</span> bear such a witness?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tellith me this! Was he not changeable?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They both&egrave; werin in one case semblable.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save that willing the Fiend deceived <span class="smcap">Eve</span>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so did she not <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, by your leave!</span><br />
<br />
Yet was this sinn&egrave; happy to mankind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Fiend deceiv&egrave;d was, for all his sleight;</span><br />
For aught he could him in his sleightis wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God, to discharge man of the heavy weight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his trespass, came down from heaven on height</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And flesh and blood he took of a Virgine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And suffered death, him to deliver of pine.</span><br />
<br />
And God, to whom there may nothing hid be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If He in woman knowen had such malice,</span><br />
As men record of them in generalty;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our Lady, of Life Reparatrice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nold have been born: but for that she of vice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was void, and full of virtue, well He wist,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Endowid! of her to be born Him list.</span><br />
<br />
Her heap&egrave;d virtue hath such excellence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all too lean is manis faculty</span><br />
To declare it; and therefore in suspense<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her due praising put must needis be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But this we witen, verily, that she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Next God, the best friend is that to Man 'longeth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Key of Mercy by her girdle hangeth!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><br />
And of mercy hath every man such need,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That razing that, farewel the joy of man!</span><br />
And of her power, now takith right good heed!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She mercy may well and purchasen can.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Depleasith her not! Honoureth that woman!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And other women honour for her sake!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And but ye do, your sorrow shall awake!</span><br />
<br />
In any book also, where can ye find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That of the workis, or the death or life,</span><br />
Of <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> spelleth or maketh any mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That women Him forsook, for woe or strife?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where was there any wight so ententife</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Abouten Him as woman? Proved none!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Apostles him forsooken everichone.</span><br />
<br />
Woman forsook him not! For all the faith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of holy church in woman left only!</span><br />
These are no lies, for Holy Writ thus saith,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look! and ye shall so find it hardily!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therefore I may well proven thereby</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That in woman reigneth stable constancy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in men is change and variancy.</span><br />
<br />
Thou Precious Gem of martyrs, Margarite!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That of thy blood dreadest none effusion!</span><br />
Thou Lover true! Thou Maiden mansuete!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou, constant Woman! in thy passion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Overcame the Fiendis temptation!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And many a wight convertid thy doctrine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unto the faith of God, holy Virgin!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><br />
But, understandeth this! I commend her nought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By encheson of her virginity.</span><br />
Trusteth, it came never into thought!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ever werry against Chastity.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ever shall. But, lo, this moveth me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her loving heart and constant to her lay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drove out of my remembrance I ne may.</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><img src="images/064.png" alt="decorative leaf" /></span>
<br />
Now holdith this for firm, and for no lie!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That this true and just commendation</span><br />
Of women tell I for no flattery;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor because of pride or elation:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But only, lo! for this intention</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To give them courage of perseverance</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In virtue, and their honour to advance.</span><br />
<br />
The more the virtue, the less is the pride.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Virtue so digne is, and so noble in kind,</span><br />
That Vice and he will not in fere abide.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He putteth vices clean out of his mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He flyeth from them, he leaveth them behind.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O, Woman! that of Virtue, art hostess;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Great is thy honour, and thy worthiness!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><img src="images/064.png" alt="decorative leaf" /></span>
<br />
Then will I thus concluden and define.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We, you command! our ministers each one</span><br />
That ready ye be our hest&egrave;s to incline!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That of these fals&egrave; men, our rebell foon,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: -7.5em;" class="dropcap"><img src="images/lflower.png" alt="L" /></span>ithe and listen, Gentlemen<br />
That be of free-born blood!<br />
I shall you tell of a good yeoman:<br />
His name was <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> was a proud outlaw,<br />
Whiles he walked on ground,<br />
So courteous an outlaw as he was one,<br />
Was never none yfound.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> stood in Bernysdale,<br />
And leaned him to a tree;<br />
And by him stood Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,<br />
A good yeoman was he:<br />
And also did good <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span>,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Much</span> the miller's son,<br />
There was no inch of his body<br />
But it was worth a groom.<br />
Then bespake him Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,<br />
All unto <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master, if ye would dine betime,</span><br />
It would do you much good!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"To dine I have no lust,<br />
Till I have some bold Baron,<br />
Or some unketh guest,<br />
That may pay for the best,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Or some Knight or some Squire<br />
That dwelleth here by West."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A good manner then had <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
In land where that he were,<br />
Every day or he would dine,<br />
Three <i>Masses</i> would he hear.<br />
The one in the worship of the Father<br />
The other of the Holy Ghost,<br />
The third was of our dear Lady<br />
That he loved, aldermost.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> loved our dear Lady;<br />
For doubt of deadly sin,<br />
Would he never do company harm<br />
That any woman was in.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master!" then said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And we our board shall spread,<br />
Tell us, Whither we shall gone,<br />
And what life we shall lead?<br />
Where we shall take? Where we shall leave?<br />
Where we shall abide behind?<br />
Where shall we rob? where shall we 'reave?<br />
Where we shall beat and bind?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thereof no force!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"We shall do well enough!<br />
But look, ye do no husband harm,<br />
That tilleth with his plough!<br />
No more ye shall no good yeoman<br />
That walketh by green-wood shaw!<br />
Ne no Knight, ne no Squire<br />
That would be a good fellaw!<br />
These Bishops and these Archbishops,<br />
Ye shall them beat and bind!<br />
The High Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>,<br />
Him hold ye in your mind!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This word shall be held," saith Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And this lesson shall we lere!<br />
It is far day, God send us a guest,<br />
That we were at our dinn&egrave;r!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take thy good bow in thy hand," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Let <span class="smcap">Much</span> wend with thee!<br />
And so shall <span class="smcap">William Scathelock</span>!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>And no man abide with me.<br />
And walk up to the Sayles,<br />
And so to Watling street,<br />
And wait after some unketh guest,<br />
Upchance, ye may them meet:<br />
Be he Earl or any Baron,<br />
Abbot or any Knight,<br />
Bring him to lodge to me!<br />
His dinner shall be dight!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They went unto the Sayles,</span><br />
These yeomen all three;<br />
They looked East, they looked West,<br />
They might no man see.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as they looked in Bernysdale,</span><br />
By a derne street,<br />
Then came there a Knight riding:<br />
Full soon they 'gan him meet.<br />
All dreary then was his semblante,<br />
And little was his pride,<br />
His one foot in the stirrup stood,<br />
That other waved beside.<br />
His hood hanged in his eyen two,<br />
He rode in simple array;<br />
A sorrier man than he was one,<br />
Rode never in summer's day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> was full curteys,</span><br />
And set him on his knee,<br />
"Welcome be ye, gentle Knight!<br />
Welcome are ye to me!<br />
Welcome be thou to green wood,<br />
Hende Knight and free!<br />
My master hath abiden you fasting,<br />
Sir! all these hours three!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who is your master?" said the Knight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">John</span> said, "<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He is a good yeoman," said the Knight;</span><br />
"Of him I have heard much good!<br />
I grant," he said, "with you to wend,<br />
My brethren all in-fere:<br />
My purpose was to have dined to-day<br />
At Blyth or Doncaster."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth then went that gentle Knight,</span><br />
With a careful cheer;<br />
The tears out of his eyen ran,<br />
And fell down by his leer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They brought him unto the lodge door:</span><br />
When <span class="smcap">Robin</span> 'gan him see,<br />
Full courteously did off his hood,<br />
And set him on his knee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome, Sir Knight!" then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Welcome thou art to me;<br />
I have abide you fasting, Sir,<br />
All these hours three!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then answered the gentle Knight</span><br />
With words fair and free,<br />
"God thee save, good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!<br />
And all thy fair meiny!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They washed together, and wiped both;</span><br />
And set till their dinner:<br />
Bread and wine they had enough,<br />
And nombles of the deer;<br />
Swans and pheasants they had full good,<br />
And fowls of the riv&egrave;r.<br />
There failed never so little a bird<br />
That ever was bred on brere.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do gladly, Sir Knight!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grammercy, Sir!" said he,</span><br />
"Such a dinner had I not<br />
Of all these weekes three:<br />
If I come again, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
Here by this country,<br />
As good a dinner, I shall thee make<br />
As thou hast made to me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grammercy, Knight!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"My dinner when I have<br />
I was never so greedy, by dear-worthy God!<br />
My dinner for to crave:<br />
But pay ere ye wend!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>;<br />
"Methinketh it is good right,<br />
It was never the manner, by dear-worthy God!<br />
A yeoman pay for a Knight!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have nought in my coffers," said the Knight,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>"That I may proffer, for shame!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Little <span class="smcap">John</span>! go look!" said <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,</span><br />
"Ne let not, for no blame,<br />
Tell me truth!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"So God have part of thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have no more but ten shillings," said the Knight,</span><br />
"So God have part of me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If thou have no more," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"I will not one penny!<br />
And if thou have need of any more;<br />
More shall I lend thee!<br />
Go now forth, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,<br />
The truth, tell thou me!<br />
If there be no more but ten shillings,<br />
Not one penny that I see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> spread down his mantle</span><br />
Full fair upon the ground;<br />
And there he found, in the Knight's coffer,<br />
But even half a pound.<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> let it lie full still,<br />
And went to his master full low.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What tidings, <span class="smcap">John</span>?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir, the Knight is true enow!"</span><br />
"Fill of the best wine!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"The Knight shall begin!<br />
Much wonder thinketh me<br />
Thy clothing is so thin!<br />
Tell me one word," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"And counsel shall it be:<br />
I trow thou wert made a Knight, of force,<br />
Or else of yeomanry!<br />
Or else thou hast been a sorry husband<br />
And lived in stroke and strife,<br />
And okerer or else a lecher," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"With wrong hast thou led thy life!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am none of them," said the Knight,</span><br />
"By God that made me!<br />
A hundred winters herebefore,<br />
My ancestors Knights have be<br />
But oft it hath befallen, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!<br />
A man hath been disgrate,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>But God that sitteth in heaven above,<br />
May amend his state!<br />
Within this two year, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!" he said,<br />
"(My neighbours well it know!)<br />
Four hundred pounds of good money<br />
Full well then might I spend.<br />
Now, have I no goods," said the Knight;<br />
"God hath shapen such an end,&mdash;<br />
But my children and my wife,<br />
Till God it may amend!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In what manner," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Hast thou lost thy riches?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For my great folly," he said,</span><br />
"And for my kindness!<br />
I had a son, forsooth, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!<br />
That should have been my heir:<br />
When he was twenty winters old,<br />
In field would joust full fair.<br />
He slew a Knight of Lancashire<br />
And a Squire bold.<br />
For to save him in his right<br />
My goods be set and sold,<br />
My lands be set to wed, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!<br />
Until a certain day<br />
To a rich Abbot here besides,<br />
Of Saint <span class="smcap">Mary's</span> Abbey."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What is the sum?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>;</span><br />
"Truth then tell thou me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir," he said, "four hundred pounds,</span><br />
The Abbot told it to me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, and thou lose thy land!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"What shall 'fall of thee?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hastily I will me busk," said the Knight,</span><br />
"Over the salt sea,<br />
And see where <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was quick and dead<br />
On the Mount of Calvary!<br />
Farewell, friend! and have good day!<br />
It may not better be!"<br />
Tears fell out of his eyen two,<br />
He would have gone his way.<br />
"Farewell, friends, and have good day!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>I ne have more to pay!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Where be thy friends?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir! never one will know me!</span><br />
While I was rich enough at home<br />
Great boast then would they blow;<br />
And now they run away from me<br />
As beasts in a row,<br />
They take no more heed of me<br />
Than they me never saw!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ruth then wept Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Scathelock</span> and <span class="smcap">Much</span> also.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fill of the best wine!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"For here is a simple cheer.<br />
Hast thou any friends," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"The borrows that will be?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have none!" then said the Knight,</span><br />
"But God that died on the tree!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do way thy japes!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thereof will I right none!<br />
Weenest thou I will have God to borrow,<br />
<span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, or <span class="smcap">John</span>?<br />
Nay, by Him that me made,<br />
And shaped both sun and moon!<br />
Find a better borrow," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Or money gettest thou none!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have none other!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"The sooth for to say,<br />
But if it be Our dear Lady<br />
She failed me never or this day!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By dear worthy God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"To seek all England through,<br />
Yet found I never to my pay<br />
A much better borrow!<br />
Come now forth, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>!<br />
And go to my treasure!<br />
And bring me four hundred pound,<br />
And look that it well told be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth then went Little <span class="smcap">John</span></span><br />
And <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span> went before,<br />
He told out four hundred pound<br />
By eighteen [? <i>eight and twenty</i>] score.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is this well told?" say Little <span class="smcap">Much</span>."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">John</span> said, "What grieveth thee?</span><br />
It is alms to help a gentle Knight<br />
That is fallen in poverty!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master!" then said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"His clothing is full thin!<br />
Ye must give the Knight a livery<br />
To lap his body therein:<br />
For ye have scarlet and green, Master!<br />
And many a rich array;<br />
There is no merchant in merry England<br />
So rich, I dare well say."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take him three yards of every colour,</span><br />
And look it well meeted be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> took none other measure</span><br />
But his bow tree;<br />
And of every handful that he met<br />
He leaped over feet three.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What devilkins draper!" said Little <span class="smcap">Much</span>,</span><br />
"Thinkst thou to be?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Scathelock</span> stood full still, and laughed,</span><br />
And said "By God Almight!<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span> may give him the better measure,<br />
For it cost him but light!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
All unto <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
"Ye must give the Knight an horse<br />
To lead home all this good."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take him a grey courser!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"And a saddle new!<br />
He is Our Lady's Messenger;<br />
God leve that he be true!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And a good palfrey," said Little <span class="smcap">Much</span>,</span><br />
"To maintain him in his right!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And a pair of boots," said <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span>,</span><br />
"For he is a gentle Knight!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What shalt thou give him, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir; a pair of gilt spurs clean,</span><br />
To pray for all this company;<br />
God bring him out of teen!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When shall my day be," said the Knight,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>"Sir! and your will be?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This day twelvemonth!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Under this green-wood tree.<br />
It were great shame," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"A Knight alone to ride;<br />
Without Squire, yeoman, or page,<br />
To walk by his side!<br />
I shall thee lend, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>, my man;<br />
For he shall be thy knave!<br />
In a yeoman's stead, he may thee stand,<br />
If thou great need have!"<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: -5em;" class="dropcap"><img src="images/nbaby.png" alt="N" /></span>ow is the Knight went on his way,<br />
This game him thought full good,<br />
When he looked on Bernysdale,<br />
He bless&egrave;d <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>:<br />
And when he bethought on Bernysdale,<br />
On <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span>, <span class="smcap">Much</span>, and <span class="smcap">John</span>;<br />
He blessed them for the best company<br />
That ever he in come.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then spake that gentle Knight,</span><br />
To Little <span class="smcap">John</span> 'gan he say,<br />
"To-morrow, I must to York town,<br />
To Saint Mary's Abbey,<br />
And to the Abbot of that place<br />
Four hundred pound I must pay:<br />
And but I be there upon this night<br />
My land is lost for aye!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Abbot said to his Convent,</span><br />
There he stood on ground:<br />
"This day twelve months came there a Knight,<br />
And borrowed four hundred pound.<br />
[He borrowed four hundred pound]<br />
Upon his land and fee;<br />
But he come this ilk day<br />
Disherited shall he be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It is full early!" said the Prior,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>"The day is not yet far gone!<br />
I had lever to pay an hundred pound<br />
And lay [it] down anon.<br />
The Knight is far beyond the sea<br />
In England is his right,<br />
And suffereth hunger and cold<br />
And many a sorry night:<br />
It were great pity," said the Prior,<br />
"So to have his land:<br />
And ye be so light of your conscience<br />
Ye do to him much wrong!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou art ever in my beard," said the Abbot;</span><br />
"By God and Saint Richard!"<br />
With that came in, a fat-headed monk,<br />
The High Cellarer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He is dead or hanged!" said the Monk,</span><br />
"By God that bought me dear!<br />
And we shall have to spend in this place,<br />
Four hundred pounds by year!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Abbot and High Cellarer</span><br />
Start forth full bold:<br />
The Justice of England,<br />
The Abbot there did hold.<br />
The High Justice, and many mo,<br />
Had taken into their hand<br />
Wholly all the Knight's debt,<br />
To put that Knight to wrong.<br />
They deemed the Knight wonder sore<br />
The Abbot and his meiny,<br />
But he come this ilk day<br />
Disherited shall he be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He will not come yet," said the Justice,</span><br />
"I dare well undertake!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in sorrow time for them all,</span><br />
The Knight came to the gate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake that gentle Knight</span><br />
Until his meiny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, put on your simple weeds</span><br />
That ye brought from the sea!"<br />
[They put on their simple weeds,]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They came to the gates anon,</span><br />
The Porter was ready himself,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>And welcomed them everych one.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome, Sir Knight!" said the Porter;</span><br />
"My Lord, to meat is he;<br />
And so is many a gentleman<br />
For the love of thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Porter swore a full great oath</span><br />
"By God that made me!<br />
Here be the best coresed horse<br />
That ever yet saw I me!<br />
Lead them into the stable!" he said,<br />
"That eas&egrave;d might they be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"They shall not come therein!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"By God that died on a tree!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lords were to meat yset</span><br />
In that Abbot's hall:<br />
The Knight went forth, and kneeled down,<br />
And salued them, great and small.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do gladly, Sir Abbot!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"I am come to hold my day!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first word the Abbot spake,</span><br />
"Hast thou brought my pay?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Not one penny!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"By God that mak&egrave;d me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou art a shrewd debtor!" said the Abbot;</span><br />
"Sir Justice, drink to me!<br />
What doest thou here," said the Abbot,<br />
"But thou hadst brought thy pay?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For God!" then said the Knight,</span><br />
"To pray of a longer day!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thy day is broke!" said the Justice;</span><br />
"Land gettest thou none!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, good Sir Justice! be my friend!</span><br />
And fend me of my fone!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am hold with the Abbot!" said the Justice,</span><br />
"Both with cloth and fee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, good Sir Sheriff! be my friend!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, for God!" said he.</span><br />
"Now, good Sir Abbot! be my friend!<br />
For thy courtesy;<br />
And hold my lands in thy hand<br />
Till I have made thee gree:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>And I will be thy true servant<br />
And truly serve thee<br />
Till ye have four hundred pounds<br />
Of money good and free."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Abbot sware a full great oath,</span><br />
"By God that died on a tree!<br />
Get thee land where thou mayest;<br />
For thou gettest none of me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By dear worthy God," then said the Knight,</span><br />
"That all this world wrought!<br />
But I have my land again,<br />
Full dear it shall be bought!<br />
God that was of Maiden born,<br />
Leave us well to speed!<br />
For it is good to assay a friend<br />
Or that a man have need!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Abbot loathly on him 'gan call:</span><br />
And villainously him 'gan look:<br />
"Out," he said, "thou false Knight!<br />
Speed thee out of my hall!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou liest!" then said the gentle Knight,</span><br />
"Abbot in thy hall!<br />
False Knight was I never,<br />
By God that made us all!"<br />
Up then stood that gentle Knight:<br />
To the Abbot, said he,<br />
"To suffer a Knight to kneel so long,<br />
Thou canst no courtesy!<br />
In jousts and in tournament<br />
Full far then have I be;<br />
And put myself as far in press<br />
As any that ever I see."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What will ye give more," said the Justice,</span><br />
"And the Knight shall make a release?<br />
And else I dare safely swear<br />
Ye hold never your land in peace!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"An hundred pounds!" said the Abbot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Justice said, "Give him two!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, by God!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"Yet get ye it not so!<br />
Though ye would give a thousand more,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Yet wert thou never the near!<br />
Shalt there never be mine heir,<br />
Abbot! Justice! ne Friar!"<br />
He started him to a board anon,<br />
Till a table round,<br />
And there he shook out of a bag<br />
Even four hundred pound.<br />
"Have here thy gold, Sir Abbot!" said the Knight,<br />
"Which that thou lentest me!<br />
Hadst thou been courteous at my coming,<br />
Rewarded shouldst thou have be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Abbot sat still, and eat no more,</span><br />
For all his royal fare:<br />
He cast his head on his shoulder,<br />
And fast began to stare.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take me my gold again!" said the Abbot,</span><br />
"Sir Justice, that I took thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Not a penny!" said the Justice,</span><br />
"By God that died on the tree!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir Abbot, and ye Men of Law!</span><br />
Now have I held my day!<br />
Now shall I have my land again<br />
For ought that you can say!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Knight started out of the door,</span><br />
Away was all his care!<br />
And on he put his good clothing,<br />
The other he left there.<br />
He went him forth full merry singing<br />
As men have told in tale,<br />
His Lady met him at the gate<br />
At home in Verysdale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome, my Lord!" said his Lady,</span><br />
"Sir, lost is all your good?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Be merry, Dame!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"And pray for <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!<br />
That ever his soul be in bliss;<br />
He helped me out of my teen.<br />
Ne had not been his kindness,<br />
Beggars had we been!<br />
The Abbot and I accorded be;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>He is served of his pay!<br />
The good yeoman lent it me,<br />
As I came by the way."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This Knight then dwelled fair at home,</span><br />
The sooth for to say,<br />
Till he had got four hundred pounds<br />
All ready for to pay.<br />
He purveyed him an hundred bows,<br />
The strings well dight;<br />
An hundred sheafs of arrows good,<br />
The heads burnished full bright:<br />
And every arrow an ell long<br />
With peacock well ydight;<br />
Ynocked all with white silver,<br />
It was a seemly sight.<br />
He purveyed him an hundred men,<br />
Well harnessed in that stead,<br />
And himself in that same set<br />
And clothed in white and red.<br />
He bare a lancegay in his hand,<br />
And a man led his mail,<br />
And riden with a light song<br />
Unto Bernysdale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at Wentbridge there was a wrestling,</span><br />
And there tarried was he:<br />
And there was all the best <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'yoeman'">yeomen</ins><br />
Of all the West country.<br />
A full fair game there was up set;<br />
A white bull up i-pight;<br />
A great courser, with saddle and bridle<br />
With gold burnished full bright;<br />
A pair of gloves, a red gold ring,<br />
A pipe of wine, in fay:<br />
What man beareth him best, Iwis<br />
The prize shall bear away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was a <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'yoeman'">yeoman</ins> in that place,</span><br />
And best worthy was he.<br />
And for he was far and fremd bestead<br />
Yslain he should have be.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Knight had ruth of his yeoman</span><br />
In place where that he stood:<br />
He said, "The yeoman should have no harm,<br />
For love of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Knight pressed into the place,</span><br />
An hundred followed him free,<br />
With bows bent and arrows sharp<br />
For to shend that company.<br />
They shouldered all and made him room<br />
To wit what he would say;<br />
He took the yeoman by the hand<br />
And gave him all the play;<br />
He gave him five marks for his wine,<br />
There it laid on the mould:<br />
And bade it should be set abroach,<br />
Drink who so would!<br />
Thus long tarried this gentle Knight<br />
Till that play was done:<br />
So long abode <span class="smcap">Robin</span> fasting,<br />
Three hours after the noon.<br />

Of Little <span class="smcap">John</span>, that was the Knight's man,<br />

That young men would go shoot,<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> fetched his bow anon<br />
And said he "would them meet."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three times, Little <span class="smcap">John</span> shot about,</span><br />
And always he sleste [<i>slit</i>] the wand:<br />
The proud Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span><br />
By the Marks 'gan stand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff swore a full great oath,</span><br />
"By Him that died on the tree!<br />
This man is the best archer<br />
That yet saw I me!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Say me now, wight young man!<br />

Wilt thou dwell with me?<br />
And every year, I will thee give<br />
Twenty marks to thy fee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have a Master," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"A courteous Knight is he;<br />
May ye get leave of him, the better may it be."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff got Little <span class="smcap">John</span></span><br />
Twelve months of the Knight;<br />
Therefore he gave him right anon<br />
A good horse and a wight.<br />
Now is Little <span class="smcap">John</span> a Sheriff's man,<br />
God give us well to speed!<br />
But always thought Little <span class="smcap">John</span><br />
To quite him well his meed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, so God me help!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And be my true lewte!<br />
I shall be the worst servant to him<br />
That ever yet had he!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It befel upon a Wednesday,</span><br />
The Sheriff on hunting was gone,<br />
And Little <span class="smcap">John</span> lay in his bed, and was forgot at home,<br />
Therefore he was fasting till it was past the noon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Good Sir Steward, I pray thee,</span><br />
Give me to dine!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
"It is long for <span class="smcap">Greenleaf</span>, fasting so long to be.<br />
Therefore I pray thee, Steward, my dinner give thou me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Shalt thou never eat nor drink," said the Steward,</span><br />
"Till my lord be come to town!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make my avow to God," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span></span><br />
"I had lever to crack thy crown!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Butler was full uncourteous,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>There he stood on floor;<br />
He started to the buttery, and shut fast the door.<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> gave the Butler such a rap<br />
His back went nigh in two<br />
Though he lived an hundred winters, the worse he should go.<br />
He spurned the door with his foot, it went up well and fine!<br />
And there he made a large 'livery<br />
Both of ale and wine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir, if ye will not dine," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"I shall give you to drink!<br />
And though ye live an hundred winters,<br />
On Little <span class="smcap">John</span> ye shall think!"<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> eat and little <span class="smcap">John</span> drank, the while he would.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff had in his kitchen a Cook,</span><br />
A stout man and a bold,<br />
"I make mine avow to God!" said the Cook,<br />
"Thou art a shrewd hind,<br />
In any household to dwell! for to ask thus to dine!"<br />
And there he lent Little <span class="smcap">John</span><br />
Good strokes three.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"These strokes liketh well.<br />
Thou art a bold man and a hardy,<br />
And so thinketh me!<br />
And ere I pass from this place<br />
Assayed better shalt thou be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> drew a good sword,</span><br />
The Cook took another in hand;<br />
They thought nothing for to flee,<br />
But stiffly for to stand.<br />
There they fought sore together,<br />
Two mile way and more;<br />
Might neither other harm do<br />
The maintenance of an hour.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And by my true lewte!<br />
Thou art one of the best swordsmen<br />
That ever yet saw I me,<br />
Couldst thou shoot as well in a bow,<br />
To green wood, thou shouldst with me!<br />
And two times in the year, thy clothing<br />
Ychanged should be!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>And every year of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
Twenty marks to thy fee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Put up thy sword," said the Cook,</span><br />
"And fellows will we be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he fetch to Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
The nombles of a doe,<br />
Good bread, and full good wine.<br />
They eat and drank thereto.<br />
And when they had drunken well,<br />
Their troths together they plight,<br />
That they would be with <span class="smcap">Robin</span><br />
That ilk same night.<br />
They did them to the treasure house<br />
As fast as they might go;<br />
The locks that were good steel,<br />
They brake them everych one.<br />
They took away the silver vessels,<br />
And all that they might get;<br />
Piece, mazers, ne spoons,<br />
Would they none forget.<br />
Also they took the good pence,<br />
Three hundred pounds and more:<br />
And did them strait to <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
Under the green-wood hoar.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God thee save, my dear master!</span><br />
And <span class="smcap">Christ</span> thee save and see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span> to Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"Welcome might thou be!<br />
And also that fair yeoman,<br />
Thou bringest there with thee!<br />
What tidings from Nottingham,<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span>? tell thou me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Well thee greeteth the proud Sheriff!</span><br />
And send thee here by me,<br />
His Cook and his silver vessels,<br />
And three hundred pounds and three!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"And to the Trinity!<br />
It was never by his good-will<br />
This good is come to me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> him there bethought</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>On a shrewd wile. Five miles in the forest he ran.<br />
Him happed at his will!<br />
Then he met the proud Sheriff<br />
Hunting with hounds and horn.<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> could his courtesy,<br />
And kneeled him beforne.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God thee save, my dear Master!</span><br />
And <span class="smcap">Christ</span> thee save and see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Reynold Greenleaf</span>!" said the Sheriff,</span><br />
"Where hast thou now be?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I have been in this forest;</span><br />
A fair sight can I see;<br />
It was one of the fairest sights<br />
That ever yet saw I me!<br />
Yonder I see a right fair hart,<br />
His colour is of green!<br />
Seven score of deer upon a herd,<br />
Be with him all bedeen,<br />
His tynde are so sharp, Master,<br />
Of sixty and well mo,<br />
That I durst not shoot for dread,<br />
Lest they would me slo!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God!" said the Sheriff,</span><br />
"That sight would I fain see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Busk you thitherward, my dear Master</span><br />
Anon, and wend with me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff rode, and Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
Of foot he was full smart;<br />
And when they came afore <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Lo, here is the master Hart!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still stood the proud Sheriff:</span><br />
A sorry man was he!<br />
"Woe the worth, <span class="smcap">Reynold Greenleaf</span>,<br />
Thou hast betrayed me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"Master, ye be to blame!<br />
I was mis-served of my dinner,<br />
When I was with you at home!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon he was to supper set,</span><br />
And served with silver white:<br />
And when the Sheriff saw his vessel,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>For sorrow, he might not eat!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Make good cheer," said <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,</span><br />
"Sheriff! for charity!<br />
And for the love of Little <span class="smcap">John</span><br />
Thy life is granted to thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they had supped well,</span><br />
The day was all agone,<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> commanded Little <span class="smcap">John</span><br />
To draw off his hosen and his shoon,<br />
His kirtle and his courtepy,<br />
That was furred well fine;<br />
And took him a green mantle,<br />
To lap his body therein.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> commanded his wight young men,<br />
Under the green-wood tree,<br />
They shall lay in that same suit,<br />
That the Sheriff might them see.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All night lay that proud Sheriff,</span><br />
In his breech and in his shirt:<br />
No wonder it was in green wood<br />
Though his sides do smart.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Make glad cheer," said <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,</span><br />
"Sheriff, for charity!<br />
For this is our order, I-wis,<br />
Under the green-wood tree!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This is harder order," said the Sheriff,</span><br />
"Than any Anchor or Frere!<br />
For all the gold in merry England,<br />
I would not long dwell here!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"All these twelve months," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thou shalt dwell with me!<br />
I shall thee teach, proud Sheriff,<br />
An outlaw for to be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ere I here another night lie," said the Sheriff,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Robin</span>, now I pray thee!<br />
Smite off my head, rather to-morn,<br />
And I forgive it thee!<br />
Let me go then," said the Sheriff,<br />
"For saint charity!<br />
And I will be thy best friend,<br />
That yet had ye!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou shalt swear me an oath!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"On my bright brand,<br />
Thou shalt never await me scathe!<br />
By water ne by land!<br />
And if thou find any of my men,<br />
By night, or by day,<br />
Upon thine oath, thou shalt swear<br />
To help them that thou may!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now has the Sheriff ysworn this oath,</span><br />
And home he began to gone;<br />
He was as full of green wood,<br />
As ever was heap of stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="images/symbol.png"  alt="&para;" /> <strong><big>The fourth fytte.</big></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: -4.5em;" class="dropcap"><img src="images/tbabysmall.png" alt="T" /></span>he Sheriff dwelled in Nottingham,<br />
He was fain that he was gone,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Robin</span> and his merry men<br />
Went to wood anon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go we to dinner?" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> said, "Nay!<br />
For I dread our Lady be wroth with me;<br />
For she [has] sent me not my pay!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Have no doubt, Master!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.</span><br />
"Yet is not the sun not at rest:<br />
For I dare say and safely swear<br />
The Knight is true and trust!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take thy bow in thy hand!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
"Let <span class="smcap">Much</span> wend with thee!<br />
And so shall <span class="smcap">William Scathelock</span>;<br />
And no man abide with me!<br />
And walk up under the Sayles,<br />
And to Watling Street;<br />
And wait after such unketh guest,<br />
Upchance ye may them meet.<br />
Whether he be messenger,<br />
Or a man that mirths can;<br />
Of my good, he shall have some<br />
If he be a poor man!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth then started Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Half in tray or teen,<br />
And girded him with a full good sword<br />
Under a mantle of green.<br />
They went up to the Sayles,<br />
These yeomen all three,<br />
They looked East, they looked West,<br />
They might no man see.<br />
But as they looked in Bernysdale,<br />
By the highway<br />
Then were they 'ware of two black monks,<br />
Each on a good palfrey.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
To <span class="smcap">Much</span> he 'gan say:<br />
"I dare lay my life to wed<br />
These monks have brought our pay!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Make glad cheer," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And frese our bows of yew!<br />
And look your hearts be sicker and sad,<br />
Your strings trusty and true!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The monk had fifty and two [men]</span><br />
And seven somers full strong,<br />
There rideth no Bishop in this land<br />
So royally I understand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brethren," said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"Here are no more but we three;<br />
But we bring them to dinner,<br />
Our Master, dare we not see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bend your bows!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"Make all yon press to stand!<br />
The foremost monk, his life and his death,<br />
Are closed in my hand.<br />
Abide, churl Monk!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,<br />
"No further that thou go,<br />
If thou dost, by dear-worthy God!<br />
Thy death is in my hand!<br />
And evil thrift on thy head!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,<br />
"Right under thy hat's band:<br />
For thou hast made our Master wroth,<br />
He is fasting so long!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who is your Master?" said the Monk.</span><br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> said, "<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He is a strong thief!" said the Monk;</span><br />
"Of him heard I never good!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou liest then!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"And that shall rue thee!<br />
He is a yeoman of the forest;<br />
To dine, he hath bidden thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Much</span> was ready with a bolt,</span><br />
Readily and anon,<br />
He set the Monk tofore the breast<br />
To the ground that he can gone.<br />
Of fifty-two wight young yeomen<br />
There abode not one;<br />
Save a little page and a groom<br />
To lead the somers with Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They brought the Monk to the lodge door,</span><br />
Whether he were loth or lief,<br />
For to speak with <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
Maugre in their teeth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> did adown his hood,</span><br />
The Monk when that he see,<br />
The Monk who was not so courteous<br />
His hood then let he be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He is a churl, Master! by dear-worthy God!"</span><br />
Then said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thereof no force!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"For courtesy can he none!<br />
How many men," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Had this Monk, <span class="smcap">John</span>?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fifty and two when that we met;</span><br />
But many of them be gone."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Let blow a horn!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"That fellowship may us know!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seven score of wight yeomen</span><br />
Came pricking on a row,<br />
And everych of them a good mantle<br />
Of scarlet and of ray,<br />
All they came to good <span class="smcap">Robin</span><br />
To wit what he would say.<br />
They made the Monk to wash and wipe,<br />
And sit at his dinner,<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> and Little <span class="smcap">John</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>They served him both in-fere.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do gladly, Monk!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grammercy, Sir!" said he.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Where is your Abbey, when ye are at home;</span><br />
And who is your avow?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"St. Mary's Abbey," said the Monk,</span><br />
"Though I be simple here."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In what office?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir! the High Cellarer."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ye be the more welcome," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So ever might I thee."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fill of the best wine!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"This Monk shall drink to me!<br />
But I have great marvel," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Of all this long day,<br />
I dread our Lady be wroth with me,<br />
She sent me not my pay!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Have no doubt, Master!" said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"Ye have no need, I say:<br />
This Monk, it hath brought, I dare well swear!<br />
For he is of her Abbey."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And She was a borrow," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Between a Knight and me,<br />
Of a little money that I him lent<br />
Under the green-wood tree;<br />
And if thou hast that silver ybrought,<br />
I pray thee let me see,<br />
And I shall help thee eftsoons<br />
If thou have need to me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Monk swore a full great oath,</span><br />
With a sorry cheer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Of the borrowhood thou speakest to me</span><br />
Heard I never ere!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Monk, thou art to blame!<br />
For God is held a righteous man,<br />
And so is his dame.<br />
Thou toldest with thine own tongue<br />
Thou mayst not say 'Nay!'<br />
How thou art her servant,<br />
And servest her every day:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>And thou art made her messenger,<br />
My money for to pay.<br />
Therefore I can the more thanks,<br />
Thou art come to thy day!<br />
What is in your coffers?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>;<br />
"True, then, tell thou me?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir!" he said, "twenty marks!</span><br />
Also might I thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If there be no more," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"I will not one penny.<br />
If thou hast myster of any more,<br />
Sir, more I shall lend to thee!<br />
And if I find more," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Iwis, thou shalt it forgo;<br />
For of thy spending silver, Monk!<br />
Thereof will I right none."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go now forth, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
And the truth, tell thou me!<br />
If there be no more but twenty marks<br />
No penny [of] that I see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> spread his mantle down,</span><br />
As he had done before,<br />
And he told out of the Monk's mail<br />
Eight hundred pound and more.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little <span class="smcap">John</span> let it lie full still,</span><br />
And went to his Master in haste;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir!" he said, "the Monk is true enough;</span><br />
Our Lady hath doubled your cast!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Monk, what told I thee!<br />
Our Lady is the truest woman<br />
That ever yet found I me!<br />
By dear worthy God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"To seek all England through;<br />
Yet found I never to my pay,<br />
A much better borrow.<br />
Fill of the best wine, and do him drink!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>;<br />
"And greet well thy Lady hend;<br />
And if she have need to <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
A friend she shall him find:<br />
And if she needeth any more silver,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Come thou again to me!<br />
And, by this token she hath me sent,<br />
She shall have such three!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Monk was going to London ward,</span><br />
There to hold great Mote,<br />
The Knight that rode so high on horse<br />
To bring him under foot.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Whither be ye away?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir, to manors in this land,</span><br />
To reckon with our Reeves<br />
That have done much wrong."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come now forth, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>!</span><br />
And hearken to my tale!<br />
A better yeoman, I know none<br />
To seek a Monk's mail.<br />
How much is in yonder other corser?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"The sooth must we see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By our Lady!" then said the Monk,</span><br />
"That were no courtesy;<br />
To bid a man to dinner,<br />
And sith him beat and bind!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It is our old manner!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"To leave but little behind."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Monk took the horse with spur,</span><br />
No longer would he abide!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ask to drink!" then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Or that ye further ride?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, for God!" said the Monk,</span><br />
"Me rueth I came so near!<br />
For better cheap, I might have dined<br />
In Blyth or in Doncaster!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Greet well, your Abbot!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"And your Prior, I you pray!<br />
And bid him send me such a Monk<br />
To dinner every day!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now let we that Monk be still;</span><br />
And speak we of the Knight!<br />
Yet he came to hold his day<br />
While that it was light.<br />
He did him strait to Bernysdale,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Under the green-wood tree.<br />
And he found there <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
And all his merry meiny.<br />
The Knight light down off his good palfrey.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> when he 'gan see;<br />
So courteously he did adown his hood<br />
And set him on his knee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God thee save, <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,</span><br />
And all this company!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome, be thou, gentle Knight!</span><br />
And right welcome to me!"<br />
Then bespake him <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
To that Knight so free,<br />
"What need driveth thee to green wood?<br />
I pray thee, Sir Knight, tell me!<br />
And welcome be, thou gentle Knight!<br />
Why hast thou been so long?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For the Abbot and high Justice</span><br />
Would have had my land?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hast thou thy land again?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Truth then tell thou me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea, for God!" said the Knight,</span><br />
"And that I thank God and thee!<br />
But take not a grief," said the Knight,<br />
"That I have been so long,<br />
I came by a wrestling,<br />
And there I helped a poor yeoman,<br />
Who with wrong was put behind."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, for God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Sir Knight, that thank I thee!<br />
What man that helpeth a good yeoman,<br />
His friend then will I be."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Have here four hundred pounds!" then said the Knight</span><br />
"The which ye lent me,<br />
And here is also twenty marks for your courtesy!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, for God!" then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thou brook it well for aye;<br />
For our Lady, by her Cellarer,<br />
Hath sent to me my pay!<br />
And if I took it twice,<br />
A shame it were to me!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>But truly, gentle Knight,<br />
Welcome art thou to me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When <span class="smcap">Robin</span> had told his tale,</span><br />
He laughed and had good cheer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By my troth!" then said the Knight,</span><br />
"Your money is ready here!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brook it well!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thou gentle Knight so free!<br />
And welcome be thou, gentle Knight,<br />
Under my trystel tree!<br />
But what shall these bows do?" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"And these arrows yfeathered free?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By God!" then said the Knight,</span><br />
"A poor present to thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come now forth, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
And go to my treasure,<br />
And bring me there four hundred pounds<br />
The Monk overtold it me.<br />
Have here four hundred pounds,<br />
Thou gentle Knight and true!<br />
And buy horse and harness good,<br />
And gilt thy spurs all new!<br />
And if thou fail any spending,<br />
Come to <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!<br />
And, by my troth, thou shalt none fail<br />
The whiles I have any good;<br />
And brook well thy four hundred pounds<br />
Which I lent to thee!<br />
And make thyself no more so bare;<br />
By the counsel of me."<br />
<br />
Thus then helped him, good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
The Knight all of his care:<br />
God that sits in heaven high<br />
Grant us well to fare!<br />

<strong><big>The fifth fytte.</big></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: -5em;" class="dropcap"><img src="images/nbaby.png" alt="N" /></span>ow hath the Knight his leave ytake,<br />
And went him on his way.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> and his merry men<br />
Dwelled still full many a day.<br />
Lithe and listen, Gentlemen!<br />
And hearken what I shall say,<br />
How the proud Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span><br />
Did cry a full fair Play,<br />
That all the best archers of the North<br />
Should come upon a day;<br />
And he that shooteth alder best,<br />
The game shall bear away!<br />
He that shooteth alder best<br />
Furthest, fair, and low,<br />
At a pair of finely butts,<br />
Under the green-wood shaw,<br />
A right good arrow he shall have,<br />
The shaft of silver white,<br />
The head and feathers of rich red gold,<br />
In England is none like.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This then heard good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
Under his trystel tree.<br />
"Make you ready, ye wight young men,<br />
That shooting will I see!<br />
Busk you, my merry young men,<br />
Ye shall go with me!<br />
And I will wit the Sheriff's faith;<br />
True and if be he!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they had their bows ybent,</span><br />
Their tackles feathered free,<br />
Seven score of wight young men<br />
Stood by <span class="smcap">Robin</span>'s knee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they came to Nottingham,</span><br />
The butts were fair and long,<br />
Many were the bold archers<br />
That shooted with bow&egrave;s strong.<br />
"There shall but six shoot with me,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>The others shall keep my head,<br />
And stand with good bows bent<br />
That I be not deceived."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fourth outlaw, his bow 'gan bend,</span><br />
And that was <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>:<br />
And that beheld the proud Sheriff,<br />
All by the butt he stood.<br />
Thrice <span class="smcap">Robin</span> shot about,<br />
And always sliced the wand;<br />
And so did good "<span class="smcap">Gilbert</span><br />
With the white hand."<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> and good <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span><br />
Were archers good and free:<br />
Little <span class="smcap">Much</span> and good <span class="smcap">Reynold</span><br />
The worst would they not be!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they had shot about,</span><br />
These archers fair and good:<br />
Ever more was the best,<br />
Forsooth, <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>.<br />
Him was delivered the good arrow,<br />
For best worthy was he:<br />
He took the gift so courteously;<br />
To green wood would he!<br />
They cried out on <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
And great horns 'gan they blow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Woe worth the treason!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>;</span><br />
"Full evil thou art to know!<br />
And woe be thou, thou proud Sheriff!<br />
Thus gladding thy guest,<br />
Otherwise thou behote me<br />
In yonder wild forest,<br />
But had I thee in green wood,<br />
Under my trystel tree,<br />
Thou shouldst leave me a better wed,<br />
Than thy true lewte."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full many a bow there was bent,</span><br />
And arrows let they glide!<br />
Many a kirtle there was rent,<br />
And hurt many a side!<br />
The outlaws' shot was so strong<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>That no man might them drive,<br />
And the proud Sheriff's men<br />
They fled away full blyve.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> saw the [am]bushment to broke,<br />
In green wood he would have been;<br />
Many an arrow there was shot<br />
Among that company.<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> was hurt full sore,<br />
With an arrow in his knee,<br />
That he might neither go nor ride:<br />
It was full great pity!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master!" then said Little <span class="smcap">John</span>,</span><br />
"If ever thou lovest me;<br />
And for that ilk Lord's love<br />
That died upon a tree!<br />
And for the meeds of my service,<br />
That I have serv&egrave;d thee:<br />
Let never the proud Sheriff<br />
Alive now find me!<br />
But take out thy brown sword<br />
And smite all off my head!<br />
And give me wounds dead and wide,<br />
No life on me be left!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I would not that," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">John</span>! that thou be slo,<br />
For all the gold in merry England,<br />
Though it lay now on a row!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God forbid!" said Little <span class="smcap">Much</span>,</span><br />
"That di&egrave;d on a tree!<br />
That thou shouldst, Little <span class="smcap">John</span>!<br />
'Part our company!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up he took him on his back,</span><br />
And bare him well nigh a mile:<br />
Many a time, he laid him down,<br />
And shot another while.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then was there a fair Castle</span><br />
A little within the wood;<br />
Double ditched it was about,<br />
And wall&egrave;d, by the rood:<br />
And there dwelt that gentle Knight,<br />
Sir <span class="smcap">Richard at the Lee</span>,<br />
That <span class="smcap">Robin</span> had lent his good<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>Under the green-wood tree.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In he took good <span class="smcap">Robin</span></span><br />
And all his company.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome be thou, <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!</span><br />
Welcome art thou, to me!<br />
And much thank thee of thy comfort<br />
And of thy courtesy,<br />
And of thy great kindness<br />
Under the green-wood tree!<br />
I love no man, in all this world<br />
So much as I do thee!<br />
For all the proud Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>;<br />
Right here shalt thou be!<br />
Shut the gates, and draw the bridge;<br />
And let no man come in!<br />
And arm you well, and make you ready!<br />
And to the wall ye win!<br />
For one thing, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>! I thee behote<br />
I swear by St. Quintin!<br />
These twelve days thou wonest with me,<br />
To sup, eat, and dine!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Boards were laid and cloths spread</span><br />
Readily and anon:<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> and his merry men<br />
To meat 'gan they gone.<br />

And hearken unto your song!<br />
How the proud Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span><br />
And men of arm&egrave;s strong<br />
Full fast came to the High Sheriff<br />
The country up to rout,<br />
And they beset the Knight's Castle,<br />
The walls all about.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The proud Sheriff loud 'gan cry</span><br />
And said, "Thou traitor Knight!<br />
Thou keepest here the King's enemy!<br />
Against the laws and right!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir, I will avow that I have done</span><br />

Wend forth, Sirs, on your way;<br />
And do no more to me,<br />
Till ye wit our King's will<br />
What he will say to thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff thus, had his answer</span><br />
Without any leasing.<br />
Forth he yode to London town,<br />
All for to tell the King.<br />
There he told them of that Knight,<br />
And eke of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>;<br />
And also of the bold archers,<br />
That noble were and good.<br />
He would avow that he had done<br />
To maintain the outlaws strong;<br />
He would be Lord, and set you at nought<br />
In all the North land.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I will be at Nottingham," said the King,</span><br />
"Within this fortnight!<br />
And take I will, <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>;<br />
And so I will that Knight!<br />
Go now home, Sheriff," said the King,<br />
"And do as I thee bid.<br />
And ordain good archers ynow<br />
Of all the wide country!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheriff had his leave ytake;</span><br />
And went him on his way.<br />
And <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> to green wood,<br />
Upon a certain day,<br />
And Little <span class="smcap">John</span> was whole of the arrow<br />
That shot was in his knee;<br />
And did him straight to <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
Under the green-wood tree.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> walked in the forest</span><br />
Under the leav&egrave;s green,<br />
The proud Sheriff of <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>,<br />
Thereof he had great teen.<br />
The Sheriff there failed of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>He might not have his prey.<br />
Then he awaited this gentle Knight,<br />
Both by night and by day.<br />
Ever he awaited that gentle Knight,<br />
Sir <span class="smcap">Richard at the Lee</span>,<br />
As he went on hawking by the river side<br />
And let his hawks flee;<br />
Took he there, this gentle Knight,<br />
With men of arm&egrave;s strong,<br />
And led him home to Nottingham ward<br />
Ybound both foot and hand.<br />
The Sheriff swore a full great oath,<br />
By Him that died on rood,<br />
He had lever than a hundred pound<br />
That he had <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This heard the Knight's wife</span><br />
A fair Lady and free,<br />
She set her on a good palfrey;<br />
To green wood anon rode she.<br />
When she came to the forest,<br />
Under the green-wood tree,<br />
Found she there <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
And all his fair meiny.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God [save] thee, good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>!</span><br />
And all thy company,<br />
For our dear Lady's love<br />
A boon, grant thou me!<br />
Let thou never my wedded Lord<br />
Shamely yslain be!<br />
He is fast ybound to Nottingham ward.<br />
For the love of thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anon then said good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
To that Lady free:<br />
"What man hath your Lord ytake?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For sooth, as I thee say,</span><br />
He is not yet three miles<br />
Pass&egrave;d on your way."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up then started good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
As a man that had been wood;<br />
"Busk you, my merry young men,<br />
For Him that died on a rood!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>And he that this sorrow forsaketh,<br />
By Him that died on a tree!<br />
Shall he never in green wood be,<br />
Nor longer dwell with me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon there were good bows ybent,</span><br />
Mo than seven score;<br />
Hedge ne ditch spare they none<br />
That were them before.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"The Knight would I fain see;<br />
And if I may him take,<br />
Yquit then shall it be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when they came to Nottingham</span><br />
They walk&egrave;d in the street,<br />
And with the proud Sheriff ywis<br />
Soon gan they meet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Abide, thou proud Sheriff!" he said,</span><br />
"Abide, and speak with me!<br />
Of some tidings of our King<br />
I would fain hear of thee!<br />
This seven year, by dear-worthy God!<br />
Ne yede I so fast on foot;<br />
I make mine avow to God, thou proud Sheriff!<br />
That it is not for thy good."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> bent a good bow,</span><br />
An arrow he drew at his will;<br />
He hit so the proud Sheriff,<br />
Upon the ground he lay full still:<br />
And or he might up arise,<br />
On his feet to stand;<br />
He smote off the Sheriff's head,<br />
With his bright brand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lie thou there, thou proud Sheriff!</span><br />
Evil might thou thrive!<br />
There might no man to thee trust,<br />
The whiles thou wert alive!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His men drew out their bright swords,</span><br />
That were so sharp and keen,<br />
And laid on the Sheriff's men<br />
And drived them down bydene.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> started to that Knight,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>And cut a two his bond;<br />
And took him in his hand a bow,<br />
And bade him by him stand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Leave thy horse thee behind,</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: -4.5em;" class="dropcap"><img src="images/tbabysmall.png" alt="T" /></span>he King came to Nottingham<br />
With Knights in great array<br />
For to take that gentle Knight<br />
And <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>, if he may.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He asked men of that country</span><br />
After <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
And after that gentle Knight<br />
That was so bold and stout.<br />
When they had told him the case,<br />
Our King understood their tale<br />
And seiz&egrave;d in his hand<br />
The Knight's land all.<br />
All the pass of Lancashire<br />
He went both far and near;<br />
Till he came to Plom[p]ton Park<br />
He failed many of his deer.<br />
There our King was wont to see<br />
Herd&egrave;s many a one,<br />
He could unneath find one deer<br />
That bare any good horn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The King was wondrous wroth withal,</span><br />
And swore, "By the Trinity!<br />
I would I had <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>!<br />
With eyen I might him see!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>And he that would smite off the Knight's head,<br />
And bring it to me;<br />
He shall have the Knight's lands<br />
Sir <span class="smcap">Richard at the Lee</span>.<br />
I give it him with my charter,<br />
And seal it [with] my hand,<br />
To have and hold for evermore<br />
In all merry England."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake a fair old Knight,</span><br />
That was true in his fay,<br />
"O my liege Lord the King,<br />
One word I shall you say!<br />
There is no man in this country<br />
May have the Knight's lands<br />
While <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> may ride or gone<br />
And bear a bow in his hands,<br />
That he ne shall lose his head,<br />
That is the best ball in his hood:<br />
Give it to no man, my Lord the King!<br />
That ye will any good!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half a year dwelled our comely King</span><br />
In Nottingham, and well more,<br />
Could he not hear of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
In what country that he were:<br />
But always went good <span class="smcap">Robin</span><br />
By halke and eke by hill,<br />
And always slew the King's deer<br />
And welt them at his will.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake a proud for'ster</span><br />
That stood by our King's knee,<br />
"If ye will see good <span class="smcap">Robin</span><br />
Ye must do after me!<br />
Take five of the best Knights<br />
That be in your lead,<br />
And walk down by yon Abbey<br />
And get you monks' weed!<br />
And I will be your leadsman<br />
And lead you the way!<br />
And or ye come to Nottingham,<br />
Mine head then dare I lay!<br />
That ye shall meet with good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>In life if that he be:<br />
Or ye come to Nottingham<br />
With eyen ye shall him see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full hastily our King was dight,</span><br />
So were his Knight&egrave;s five,<br />
Everych of them in monks' weed,<br />
And hasted them thither blithe.<br />
Our King was great above his cowl,<br />
A broad hat on his crown.<br />
Right as he were Abbot like,<br />
They rode up into the town.<br />
Stiff boots our King had on,<br />
For sooth as I you say,<br />
He rode singing to green wood,<br />
The convent was clothed in grey.<br />
His mail horse and his great somers<br />
Followed our King behind,<br />
Till they came to green wood<br />
A mile under the lynde.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There they met with good <span class="smcap">Robin</span></span><br />
Standing on the way,<br />
And so did many a bold archer,<br />
For sooth as I you say.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> took the King's horse,</span><br />
Hastily in that stead:<br />
And said, "Sir Abbot! by your leave;<br />
A while ye must abide!<br />
We be yeoman of this forest,<br />
Under the green-wood tree,<br />
We live by our King's deer,<br />
Under the green-wood tree;<br />
And ye have churches and rents both,<br />
And gold full great plenty:<br />
Give us some of your spending,<br />
For saint charity!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake our comely King,</span><br />
Anon then said he,<br />
"I brought no more to green wood.<br />
But forty pounds with me.<br />
I have lain at Nottingham,<br />
This fortnight with our King;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>And spent I have full much good<br />
On many a great Lording:<br />
And I have but forty pounds,<br />
No more than have I me.<br />
But if I had a hundred pounds,<br />
I would give it to thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> took the forty pounds,</span><br />
And departed it in two parts:<br />
Halfendell he gave his merry men,<br />
And bade them merry to be.<br />
Full courteously <span class="smcap">Robin</span> 'gan say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir, have this for your spending!</span><br />
We shall meet another day."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grammercy!" then said our King.</span><br />
"But well thee greeteth <span class="smcap">Edward</span> our King,<br />
And sent to thee his seal;<br />
And biddeth thee come to Nottingham,<br />
Both to meat and meal!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took out the broad targe</span><br />
And soon he let him see.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> could his courtesy,<br />
And set him on his knee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I love no man in all the world</span><br />
So well as I do my King!<br />
Welcome is my Lord's seal!<br />
And monk for thy tiding,<br />
Sir Abbot, for thy tidings,<br />
To-day, thou shalt dine with me!<br />
For the love of my King,<br />
Under my trystel tree."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth he led our comely King</span><br />
Full fair by the hand;<br />
Many a deer there was slain,<br />
And full fast dightand.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> took a full great horn,<br />
And loud he 'gan blow,<br />
Seven score of wight young men<br />
Came ready on a row.<br />
All they kneeled on their knee<br />
Full fair before <span class="smcap">Robin</span>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The King said, himself until,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>And swore, "By Saint <span class="smcap">Austin</span>!<br />
Here is a wondrous seemly sight!<br />
Methinketh, by God's pine!<br />
His men are more at his bidding<br />
Than my men be at mine."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full hastily was their dinner ydight,</span><br />
And thereto 'gan they gone;<br />
They served our King with all their might,<br />
Both <span class="smcap">Robin</span> and Little <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
Anon before our King was set<br />
The fat venison,<br />
The good white bread, the good red wine,<br />
And thereto the fine ale brown.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Make good cheer!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Abbot, for charity!<br />
And for this ilk tiding<br />
Bless&egrave;d might thou be!<br />
Now shalt thou see what life we lead,<br />
Or thou hence wend,<br />
That thou may inform our King<br />
When ye together lend."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up they start all in haste,</span><br />
Their bows were smartly bent:<br />
Our King was never so sore aghast;<br />
He wended to have been shent!<br />
Two yards there were up set<br />
Thereto 'gan they gang.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By fifty paces," our King said,</span><br />
"The marks were too long!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On every side a rose garland,</span><br />
They shot under the line.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Whoso faileth of the rose garland," saith <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"His tackle he shall tine,<br />
And yield it to his Master,<br />
Be it never so fine!<br />
(For no man will I spare,<br />
So drink I ale or wine!)<br />
And bear a buffet on his head<br />
Iwis right all bare."<br />
And all that fell in <span class="smcap">Robin</span>'s lot,<br />
He smote them wondrous sore.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twice <span class="smcap">Robin</span> shot about,</span><br />
And ever he cleaved the wand;<br />
And so did good "<span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>,<br />
With the good white hand."<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> and good <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span>,<br />
For nothing would they spare.<br />
When they failed of the garland<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> smote them full sore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the last shot, that <span class="smcap">Robin</span> shot</span><br />
For all his friends' fare;<br />
Yet he failed of the garland<br />
Three fingers and more.<br />
Then bespake good <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>,<br />
And thus he 'gan say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Master," he said, "your tackle is lost,</span><br />
Stand forth and take your pay!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If it be so," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"That may no better be;<br />
Sir Abbot, I deliver thee mine arrow!<br />
I pray thee, Sir, serve thou me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It falleth not for mine order," said our King,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Robin</span>, by thy leave,<br />
For to smite no good yeoman,<br />
For doubt I should him grieve."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Smite on boldly," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"I give thee large leave!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anon our King, with that word,</span><br />
He folded up his sleeve,<br />
And such a buffet he gave <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
To ground he yede full near.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"I make mine avow to God," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thou art a stalwart frere!<br />
There is pith in thine arm," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I trow thou canst well shoot."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus our King and <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,</span><br />
Together then they met.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> beheld our comely King,<br />
Wistly in the face:<br />
So did Sir <span class="smcap">Richard at the Lee</span>,<br />
And kneeled down in that place.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>And so did all the wild outlaws,<br />
When they see them kneel.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My Lord, the King of England,</span><br />
Now I know you well."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mercy, then, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>," said our King,</span><br />
"Under your trystel tree,<br />
Of thy goodness and thy grace,<br />
For my men and me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yes, for God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"and also God me save!<br />
I ask mercy, my Lord the King,<br />
And for my men I crave!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yes, for God!" then said our King,</span><br />
"And thereto 'sent I me;<br />
With that thou leave the green wood,<br />
And all thy company;<br />
And come home, Sir, to my Court,<br />
And there dwell with me."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I make mine avow to God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"And right so shall it be,<br />
I will come to your Court,<br />
Your service for to see!<br />
And bring with me, of my men,<br />
Seven score and three.<br />
But me like well your service,<br />
I come again full soon;<br />
And shoot at the dun deer<br />
As I wont to done."<br />

"That thou wilt sell now to me?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea, for God!" said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Thirty yards and three."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Robin</span>," said our King,</span><br />
"Now pray I thee!<br />
Sell me some of that cloth<br />
To me and my meiny."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yes, for God!" then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"Or else I were a fool!<br />
Another day ye will me clothe,<br />
I trow against the yule."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The King cast off his cowl then,</span><br />
A green garment he did on,<br />
And every knight also, i-wis,<br />
Another had full soon.<br />
When they were clothed in Lincoln green,<br />
They cast away their gray.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now we shall to Nottingham!</span><br />
All thus," our King 'gan say.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their bows bent, and forth they went,</span><br />
Shooting all in-fere<br />
Toward the town of Nottingham,<br />
Outlaws as they were.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our King and <span class="smcap">Robin</span> rode together,</span><br />
For sooth as I you say,<br />
And they shot Pluck-buffet,<br />
As they went by the way.<br />
And many a buffet our King won<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> that day;<br />
And nothing spared good <span class="smcap">Robin</span><br />
Our King in his pay.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So God me help!" said our King,</span><br />
"Thy game is nought to lere;<br />
I should not get a shot of thee,<br />
Though I shoot all this year!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the people of Nottingham,</span><br />
They stood and beheld,<br />
They saw nothing but mantles of green<br />
That covered all the field:<br />
Then every man to other 'gan say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I dread our King be slone;</span><br />
Come <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> to the town, ywis<br />
In life he left never one!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full hastily they began to flee,</span><br />
Both yeomen and knaves,<br />
And old wives that might evil go<br />
They hipp&egrave;d on their staves.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The King laughed full fast,</span><br />
And commanded them again:<br />
When they see our comely King<br />
I-wis they were full fain.<br />
They eat and drank and made them glad,<br />
And sang with not&egrave;s high.<br />
Then bespake our comely King<br />
To Sir <span class="smcap">Richard at the Lee</span>:<br />
He gave him there his land again;<br />
A good man he bade him be.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> thanked our comely King<br />
And set him on his knee.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had <span class="smcap">Robin</span> dwelled in the King's Court</span><br />
But twelve months and three;<br />
That he had spent an hundred pound,<br />
And all his men's fee.<br />
In every place where <span class="smcap">Robin</span> came,<br />
Evermore he laid down,<br />
Both for Knights and for Squires<br />
To get him great renown.<br />
By then the year was all agone<br />
He had no man but twain,<br />
Little <span class="smcap">John</span> and good <span class="smcap">Scathelock</span><br />
With him all for to gone.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin</span> saw young men shoot<br />
Full far upon a day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas," then said good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"My wealth is went away!<br />
Sometime I was an archer good,<br />
A stiff, and eke a strong,<br />
I was counted the best arch&egrave;r<br />
That was in merry England.<br />
Alas," then said good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,<br />
"Alas, and well a wo!<br />
If I dwell longer with the King,<br />
Sorrow will me slo!"<br />
Forth then went <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,<br />
Till he came to our King:<br />
"My Lord the King of England,<br />
Grant me mine asking!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>I made a chapel in Bernysdale,<br />
That seemly is to see:<br />
It is of <span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span>;<br />
And thereto would I be!<br />
I might never in this seven night<br />
No time to sleep ne wink;<br />
Neither all these seven days<br />
Neither eat ne drink:<br />
Me longeth sore to Bernysdale.<br />
I may not be therefro,<br />
Barefoot and woolward I have hight<br />
Thither for to go."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If it be so," then said our King,</span><br />
"It may no better be!<br />
Seven nights I give thee leave,<br />
No longer, to dwell from me."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Grammercy, Lord!" then said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
And set him on his knee.<br />
He took his leave full courteously<br />
To green wood then went he.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he came to green wood</span><br />
In a merry morning,<br />
There he heard the not&egrave;s small<br />
Of birds, merry singing.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It is far gone," said <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
"That I was last here.<br />
Me list a little for to shoot<br />
At the dun deer."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> slew a full great hart,</span><br />
His horn then 'gan he blow,<br />
That all the outlaws of that forest,<br />
That horn could they know.<br />
And gathered them together<br />
In a little throw,<br />
Seven score of wight young men<br />
Came ready on a row,<br />
And fair did off their hoods<br />
And set them on their knee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Welcome!" they said, "our Master!</span><br />
Under this green-wood tree!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robin</span> dwelled in green wood</span><br />
Twenty years and two;<br />
For all dread of <span class="smcap">Edward</span> our King<br />
Again would he not go.<br />
Yet was he beguiled i-wis<br />
Through a wicked woman,<br />
The Prioress of Kirkesley.<br />
That nigh was of his kin,<br />
For the love of a Knight,<br />
Sir <span class="smcap">Roger</span> of Donkesley.<br />
That was her own special<br />
(Full evil might they thee!)<br />
They took together their counsel<br />
<span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span> for to slee,<br />
And how they might best do that deed<br />
His banes for to be.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bespake good <span class="smcap">Robin</span>,</span><br />
In place where as he stood,<br />
"To-morrow, I must to Kirkesley<br />
Craftily to be let blood!"<br />
Sir <span class="smcap">Roger</span> of Doncaster,<br />
By the Prioress he lay:<br />
And there they betrayed good <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span><br />
Through their false play.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> have mercy on his soul!<br />
(That died on the rood)<br />
For he was a good outlaw,<br />
And did poor men much good.</div>

good Reader! the Examination of the blessed Man of GOD, and there thou
shalt easily perceive wherefore our Holy Church (as the most unholy
sort of all the people will be called) make all their examinations in
darkness; all the lay people clean excluded from their counsels.</i></p>

<p><i>For if their lies had been openly confuted, and also that the Accused
of Heresy might as well have been admitted to reason their</i> Articles
<i>with Counsel, whether they were heresy or no[t], as the Accused of
Treason against the King is admitted to his Council to confute his
cause and</i> Articles, <i>whether they be treason or not, they should
never have murdered nor prisoned so many good Christian men as they
have done.</i></p>

<p><i>For their cloaked lies could never have continued so long in the
light, as they have done in corners. They, good men! when they come in
the pulpit, and preach against the Truth, cry, "If their learning</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, of the Protestants] <i>were good and true, they would never go
in corners; but speak it openly!"</i></p>

<p><i>Whereunto I answer, that besides that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles were
compelled (for because of the furiousness of their fathers, the
Bishops and Priests, which only, that time also, would be called Holy
Church) oftentimes for to walk secretly, and absent themselves, and
give place to their malice. Yet we have daily examples, of more than
one or two, that have not spared nor feared for to speak, and also</i>
[<i>to</i>] <i>preach openly the Truth; which have been taken of them,
prisoned, and brent: besides others that for fear of death, have
abjured and carried faggots. Of whose</i> Articles <i>and Examination there
is no layman that can shew a word.</i></p>

[contrivance] <i>ever when they have put to death or punished any man:
after their secret Examinations, to slander him of such things as he
never thought; as they may do well enough, seeing there is no man to
contrary them.</i></p>

<p><i>Wherefore I exhort thee, good brother! whosoever thou be that readest
this treatise, mark it well, and consider it seriously! and there thou
shalt find, not only what the Church is, their doctrine of the
Sacrament, the Worshipping of Images, Pilgrimage, Confession,
Swearing, and Paying of Tithes: but also thou mayest see what strong
and substantial arguments of Scripture and Doctors, and what clerkly
reasons my Lord the head and Primate of the Holy Church in England (as
he will be taken) bringeth against this poor, foolish, simple, and mad
losell, knave, and heretic, as he calleth him. And also the very cause
wherefore all their Examinations are made in darkness.</i></p>

knoweth all things, wotteth well that I am right
sorrowful for to write or make known this Sentence beneath written,
where that of mine even Christian, set in high state and dignity, so
great blindness and malice may be known; that they, that presume of
themselves to destroy vices and to plant in men virtues, neither dread
to offend GOD, nor lust [<i>desire</i>] to please Him: as their works shew.
For, certes, the bidding of GOD and His Law (which, in the praising of
His most Holy Name, He commandeth to be known and kept of all men and
women, young and old; after the cunning and power that He hath given
to them), the Prelates of this land and their ministers, with the
comente [<i>community</i>] of priests chiefly consenting to them, enforce
them most busily to withstand and destroy the holy Ordinance of GOD.
And therethrough, GOD is greatly wroth and moved to take hard
vengeance, not only on them that do the evil, but also on them all
that consent to the Antichrist's limbs; which know or might know their
malice and their falsehood, and [ad]dress them not to withstand their
malice and great pride.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The four motives to this Narrative.</span></div>

<p>Nevertheless, four things moveth me to write this Sentence beneath.</p>

<p class="hang">The first thing, that moveth me hereto is this, that whereas it
was known to certain friends that I came from the prison of
Shrewsbury, and (as it befell in deed), that I should to the
prison of Canterbury; then divers friends, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>in divers places,
spake to me full heartfully and full tenderly, and commanded me
then, if it so were that I should be examined before the
Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, that, if I might in any wise, I should
write mine Apposing and mine Answering. And I promised to my
special friends, that if I might, I would gladly do their
biddings, as I might.</p>

<p class="hang">The second thing that moveth me to write this Sentence is this.
Divers friends which have heard that I have been examined before
the Archbishop, have come to me in prison and counselled me
busily, and coveted greatly that I should do the same thing. And
other brethren have sent to me, and required me, on GOD's behalf!
that I should write out and make known both mine Apposing and
mine Answering "for the profit that," as they say, "over my
[ac]knowledging may come thereof." But this, they bade me, that I
should be busy in all my wits to go as near the Sentence and the
words as I could; both that were spoken to me, and that I spake:
up[on] adventure this Writing came another time, before the
Archbishop and his Council. And of this counselling I was right
glad! for in my conscience, I was moved to do this thing; and to
ask hereto the special help of GOD.</p>

<p class="indent2">And so then, I considering the great desire of divers friends of
sundry places, according all in one; I occupied all my mind and
my wits so busily, that through GOD's grace, I perceived by their
meaning and their charitable desire some profit might come
therethrough.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Truth impugned, hath a sweet smell.</span></div>

<p class="indent2">For Soothfastness and Truth hath these conditions. Wherever it is
impugned, it hath a sweet smell, and thereof comes a sweet
savour. And the more violent the enemies [ad]dress themselves to
oppress and to withstand the Truth, the greater and the sweeter
smell cometh thereof. And therefore this heavenly smell of GOD's
Word will not, as a smoke, pass away with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> wind; but it will
descend and rest in some clean soul that thirsteth thereafter.</p>

<p class="indent2">And thus, some deal, by this Writing, may be perceived, through
GOD's grace, how that the enemies of the Truth, standing boldly
in their malice, enforce them to withstand the freedom of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s Gospel; for which freedom, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> became man, and shed
his heart's blood. And therefore it is great pity and sorrow that
many men and women do their own wayward will; nor busy them not
to know nor to do the pleasant will of GOD.</p>

<p class="indent2">Ye men and women that hear the Truth and Soothfastness, and hear
or know of this, perceiving what is now in the Church, ought
therethrough to be the more moved in all their wits to able them
to grace, and set lesser price by themselves: that they, without
tarrying, forsake wilfully [<i>voluntarily</i>] and bodily all the
wretchedness of this life; since they know not how soon, nor
when, nor where, nor by whom GOD will teach them, and assay their
patience. For, no doubt, who that ever will live piteously, that
is charitably, in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesu</span> shall suffer now, here in this
life, persecution in one wise or another, that is, if we shall be
saved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">This Story may startle some consciences.</span></div>

<p class="indent2">It behoveth us to imagine full busily, the vilite and foulness of
sin, and how the LORD GOD is displeased therefore: and of this
vilite of hideousness of sin, it behoveth us to busy us in all
our wits for to abhor and hold in our mind a great shame of sin,
ever! and so then we owe [<i>ought</i>] to sorrow heartily therefore,
and ever flying all occasion thereof. And then [it] behoveth us
to take upon us sharp penance, continuing therein, for to obtain
of the LORD, forgiveness of our foredone sins, and grace to
abstain us hereafter from sin! And but if [<i>except</i>] we enforce
us to do this wilfully and in convenient time, the LORD (if He
will not utterly destroy and cast us away!) will, in divers
manners, move tyrants against us, for to constrain us violently
for to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> penance, which we would not do wilfully. And, trust!
that this doing is a special grace of the LORD, and a great token
of life and mercy!</p>

<p class="indent2">And, no doubt, whoever will not apply himself, as is said before,
to punish himself wilfully, neither will suffer patiently,
meekly, and gladly the rod of the LORD, howsoever that He will
punish him: their wayward wills and their impatience are unto
them earnest of everlasting damnation.</p>

<p class="indent2">But because there are but few in number that do able them thus
faithfully to grace, for to live here simply and purely, and
without gall of malice and of grudging, herefore the lovers of
this world hate and pursue them that they know patient, meek,
chaste, and wilfully poor, hating and fleeing all worldly
vanities and fleshly lusts. For, surely, their virtuous
conditions are even contrary to the manners of this world.</p>

<p class="hang">The third thing that moveth me to write this Sentence is this. I
thought I shall busy me in myself to do faithfully, that all men
and women occupying all their business in knowing and in keeping
of GOD's commandments, able them so to grace, that they might
understand truly the Truth, and have and use virtue and prudence;
and so to serve to be lightened from above with heavenly wisdom:
so that all their words and their works may be hereby made
pleasant sacrifices unto the LORD GOD; and not only for help for
their own souls, but also for edification of all Holy Church.</p>

<p class="indent2">For I doubt not but all they that will apply them to have this
foresaid business shall profit full mickle both to friends and to
foes. For some enemies of the Truth, through the grace of GOD,
shall, through charitable folks, be made astonied in their
conscience, and peradventure converted from vices to virtues; and
also they that labour to know and to keep faithfully the biddings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>of GOD, and to suffer patiently all adversities, shall hereby
comfort many friends.</p>

<p class="hang">And the fourth thing that moveth me to write this Sentence is
this. I know my sudden and unwarned Apposing and Answering that
all they that will of good heart without feigning able themselves
wilfully and gladly, after their cunning and their power, to
follow <span class="smcap">Christ</span> patiently, travailing busily, privily and apertly,
in work and in word, to withdraw whomsoever that they may from
vices, planting in them (if they may) virtues, comforting them
and furthering them that standeth in grace; so that therewith
they be not borne up into vainglory through presumption of their
wisdom, nor enflamed with any worldly prosperity: but ever meek
and patient, purposing to abide steadfastly in the Will of GOD,
suffering wilfully and gladly, without any grudging whatsoever,
the rod the LORD will chastise them with.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Innocence receives Divine help.</span></div>

<p class="indent2">Then this good LORD will not forget to comfort all such men and
women in all their tribulations, and at every point of temptation
that any enemy purposeth for to do against them ([to] such
faithful lovers specially, and patient followers of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>), the
LORD sendeth His wisdom from above to them! which the adversaries
of the Truth may not know nor understand; but through their old
and new unshamefast sins, those tyrants and enemies of
Soothfastness shall be so blinded and obstinate in evil, that
they shall ween themselves to do pleasant sacrifices unto the
LORD GOD in their malicious and wrongful pursuing and destroying
of innocent men's and women's bodies; which men and women for
their very virtuous living and for their true knowledging of the
Truth and their patient, wilful, and glad suffering of
persecution for righteousness, deserve through the grace of GOD
to be heirs of the endless bliss of heaven.</p>

<p class="indent2">And for [<i>on account of</i>] the fervent desire and the great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>love
that those men have, as to stand in Soothfastness and witness of
it, though they be, suddenly and unwarned, brought forth to be
Apposed of their adversaries: the HOLY GHOST yet, that moveth and
ruleth them, through His charity, will, in the hour of their
Answering, speak in them, and shew His wisdom, that all their
enemies shall not again say [<i>gainsay</i>] and against stand
lawfully [<i>by right</i>].</p>


<p>And therefore all they that are stedfast in the faith of GOD, yea,
which (through diligent keeping of His commandments, and for their
patient suffering of whatsoever adversity that cometh to them) hope
surely in His mercy, purposing to stand continually in perfect
charity: for those men and women dread not so the adversities of this
life, that they will fear (after their cunning and their power) to
[ac]knowledge prudently the truth of GOD's Word! when, where, and to
whom that they think their [ac]knowledging may profit. Yea, and though
therefore, persecution come to them, in one wise or another, certes,
they patiently take it! knowing their conversation to be in heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Heaven is the</span> LORD GOD <span class="smcap">Himself.</span></div>

<p>It is a high reward and a special grace of GOD for to have and enjoy
as the everlasting inheritance of heaven, for the suffering of one
persecution in so short a time as is the term of this life. For, lo,
this heavenly heritage and endless reward is the LORD GOD Himself!
which is the best thing that may be. This Sentence witnesseth the LORD
GOD Himself, whereas He said to <span class="smcap">Abraham</span>, <i>I am thy mede!</i> And as the
LORD said He was, and is the mede of <span class="smcap">Abraham</span>; so He is of all His
other saints.</p>

<p>This most blessed and best mede He grant to us all! for His holy name,
that made us of nought, and sent His only most dear worthy Son, our
Lord <span class="smcap">Jesu Christ</span>, for to redeem</p>
<div class="center">us with His most precious<br />
heart's blood.<br />
Amen.<br /></div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/kflowersmall.png" style="margin-right: .25em; margin-bottom: .25em;" alt="K" /></span>nown be it to all men that read or hear this Writing beneath, that on
the Sunday next [<i>August 7th</i>] after the Feast of St. Peter that we
call Lammas [<i>August 1st</i>], in the year of our Lord a thousand four
hundred seventh year, I, <span class="smcap">William</span> of Thorpe, being in prison in the
castle of Saltwood [<i>near Hythe, in Kent</i>], was brought before <span class="smcap">Thomas
Arundell</span>, Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, and [Lord] Chancellor then of
England.</p>

<p>And when that I came to him, he stood in a great chamber, and much
people [were] about him; and when that he saw me, he went fast into a
closet [<i>private room</i>], bidding all secular men [<i>laymen</i>] that
followed him, to go forth from him soon; so that no man was left then
in that closet, but the Archbishop himself, a physician that was
called <span class="smcap">Malveren</span> [<i>i.e., <span class="smcap">John Malverne</span>, S.T.P.</i>], Parson of St.
Dunstan's [Church, in Tower Street] in London, and two other persons
unknown to me, which were Ministers of the Law [<i>i.e., the Canon Law:
later on, they are called Clerks, i.e., Chaplains</i>].</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A precise &amp; authentic Lollard <i>Creed</i>.</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And I standing before them, by and by, the Archbishop said
to me, "<span class="smcap">William</span>! I know well, that thou hast, this twenty winter and
more [<i>i.e., from before 1387</i>], travelled about busily, in the North
country and in other divers countries [<i>counties</i>] of England, sowing
about false doctrine: having great business, if thou might, with thine
untrue teaching and shrewd will, for to infect and poison all this
land. But, through the grace of GOD! thou art now withstanded, and
brought into my ward! so that I shall now sequester thee from thine
evil purpose, and let [<i>hinder</i>] thee to envenom the sheep of my
Province. Nevertheless, St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith, <i>If it may be, as far as in us
is, we owe</i> [ought] <i>to have peace with all men.</i> Therefore, <span class="smcap">William</span>!
if thou wilt now, meekly, and of good heart, without any feigning,
kneel down and lay thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> hand upon a book, and kiss it; promising
faithfully as I shall here charge thee, that 'thou wilt submit thee to
my correction and stand to mine ordinance, and fulfil it duly by all
thy cunning and power,' thou shalt yet find me gracious unto thee!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> Then said I, to the Archbishop, "Sir, since ye deem me an
heretic out of belief, will ye give me here audience to tell my
<i>Belief</i>."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And he said, "Yea, tell on!"</p>

<p class="hang"><b>William.</b> And I said, <i>"I believe that there is not but one GOD
Almighty, and in this Godhead and of this Godhead are three Persons;
that is the Father, the Son, and the soothfast HOLY GHOST. And I
believe that all these three Persons are even in power, in cunning,
and in might, full of grace and of all goodness: for whatever that the
Father doth or can or will, that thing also the Son doth can and will;
and in all their power cunning and will, the HOLY GHOST is equal to
the Father and to the Son.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Over this, I believe that, through counsel of this most blessed
Trinity (in most convenient time, before ordained), for the
salvation of mankind, the second Person of this Trinity was
ordained to take the form of Man, that is the Kind of man. And I
believe that this second Person, our Lord <span class="smcap">Jesu Christ</span> was
conceived, through the HOLY GHOST, into the womb of the most
blessed Virgin <span class="smcap">Mary</span> without any man's seed. And I believe that
after nine months, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was born of this most blessed Virgin
without any pain or breaking of the closter of her womb, and
without filth of her virginity.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Saviour was circumcised in the eighth
day after his birth, in fulfilment of the Law; and his name was called
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, which was called of the angel before he was conceived in the
womb of <span class="smcap">Mary</span> his mother.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, as he was about thirty years old, was
baptized in the flood of Jordan of <span class="smcap">John</span></i> [the] <i>Baptist, and in
likeness of a dove the HOLY GHOST descended there upon him; and a
voice was heard from heaven, saying,</i> Thou art my well beloved Son! In
Thee, I am full pleased!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was moved then by the HOLY GHOST for to go
into [the] desert, and there he fasted forty</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> <i>days and forty nights
without bodily meat and drink. And I believe that by and by, after his
fasting, when the manhood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hungered, the Fiend came to him
and tempted him in gluttony, in vainglory, and in covetise: but in all
those temptations <span class="smcap">Christ</span> concluded</i> [confounded] <i>the Fiend and
withstood him.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And then, without tarrying, <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> began to preach, and to say unto the
people,</i> Do ye penance! for the Realm of Heaven is now at hand!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, in all his time here, lived most holily;
and taught the Will of his Father most truly: and I believe that he
suffered therefore most wrongfully, greatest reproofs and despisings.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And after this, when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would make an end here, of his temporal
life, I believe that, in the day next before that he would suffer
passion on the morn, in form of bread and wine, he ordained the
Sacrament of his flesh and blood, that is his own precious body, and
gave it to his Apostles for to eat, commanding them, and by them all
their after-comers, that they should do it, in this form that he
shewed to them, use themselves and teach and common forth to other men
and women this most worshipful holiest Sacrament; in mindfulness of
his holiest Living and of his most true Teaching, and of his wilful
and patient Suffering of the most painful Passion.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that thus, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Saviour, after that he had
ordained this most worthy Sacrament of his own precious body, he went
forth wilfully against his enemies, and he suffered them most
patiently to lay their hands most violently upon him, and to bind him,
and to lead him forth as a thief, and to scorn and buffet him, and all
to blow or</i> [de]<i>file him with their spittings.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Over this, I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> suffered, most meekly and patiently,
his enemies for to ding</i> [beat] <i>out with sharp scourges, the blood
that was between his skin and his flesh: yea, without grudging, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
suffered wicked Jews to crown him with most sharp thorns, and to
strike him with a reed. And, after, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> suffered wicked Jews to
draw</i> [lay] <i>him out upon the Cross, and for to nail him there, upon
foot and hand; and so, through this pitiful nailing, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shed out
wilfully, for man's life, the blood that was in his veins: and then,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> gave</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> <i>wilfully his spirit into the hands or power of his
Father. And so, as he would, and when he would, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> died wilfully,
for man's sake, upon the Cross. And notwithstanding that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was
wilfully, painfully, and most shamefully put to death as to the world,
there was left blood and water in his heart, as he before ordained
that he would shed out this blood and this water for man's salvation.
And therefore he suffered the Jews to make a blind</i> [ignorant] <i>Knight
to thrust him into the heart with a spear; and this the blood and
water that was in his heart, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would shed out for man's love.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And, after this, I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was taken down from the Cross,
and buried.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that on the third day, by the power of his godhead,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> rose again from death to life. And forty days thereafter, I
believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> ascended up into heaven; and that he there sitteth
on the right hand of GOD the Father Almighty. And the tenth day after
his up going, he sent to his Apostles the HOLY GHOST, that he had
promised them before.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shall come and judge all mankind, some to
everlasting peace, and some to everlasting pains.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And as I believe in the Father, and in the Son, that they are one GOD
Almighty; so I believe in the HOLY GHOST that is also, with them, the
same GOD Almighty.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And I believe</i> [in] <i>an Holy Church, that is, all they that have
been, and that now are, and always to the end of the world shall be, a
people the which shall endeavour them to know, and keep the
commandments of GOD; dreading over all things to offend GOD, and
loving and seeking most to please Him. And I believe that all they
that have had, and yet have, and all they that yet shall have the
foresaid virtues, surely standing in the Belief of GOD, hoping
steadfastly in His merciful doings, continuing to their end in perfect
charity, wilfully patiently and gladly suffering persecutions by the
example of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> chiefly and His Apostles; and these have their names
written in the Book of Life. Therefore I believe that the gathering
together of this people living now in this life, is the Holy Church of
GOD, fighting here on earth against the Fiend, the prosperity of the
world, and their fleshly lusts. Wherefore, seeing that all the
gathering together of this Church beforesaid, and every part thereof,
neither coveteth, nor willeth, nor loveth, nor seeketh</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> <i>anything, but
to eschew the offence of GOD, and to do His pleasing will: meekly,
gladly, and wilfully, of all mine heart, I submit myself unto this
Holy Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; to be ever buxom and obedient to the ordinance
of it, and of every member thereof, after my knowledge and power, by
the help of GOD.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Therefore I</i> [ac]<i>knowledge now, and evermore shall (if GOD will!)
that, of all my heart, and of all my might, I will submit me only to
the rule and governance of them whom, after my knowledge, I may
perceive, by the having and using of the beforesaid virtues, to be
members of the Holy Church.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Wherefore these Articles of Belief and all others, both of the Old
Law and of the New, which, after the commandment of GOD, any man ought
to believe, I believe verily in my soul, as a sinful deadly wretch of
my cunning and power ought to believe; praying the LORD GOD, for His
holy name, for to increase my belief, and help my unbelief.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>And for because, to the praising of GOD's name, I desire above all
things to be a faithful member of Holy Church, I make this
Protestation before you all four that are now here present, coveting
that all men and women that</i> [are] <i>now absent knew the same; that
what thing soever before this time I have said or done, or what thing
here I shall do or say at any time hereafter, I believe that all the
Old Law and the New Law given and ordained by the counsel of these
three Persons in the Trinity, were given and written to</i> [for] <i>the
salvation of mankind. And I believe these Laws are sufficient for the
man's salvation. And I believe every Article of these Laws to the
intent that these Articles were ordained and commanded, of these three
Persons of the most blessed Trinity, to be believed. And therefore to
the rule and the ordinance of these, GOD's Laws, meekly, gladly, and
wilfully, I submit me with all mine heart: that whoever can or will,
by authority of GOD's Law, or by open reason, tell me that I have
erred, or now err, or any time hereafter shall err in any Article of
Belief (from which inconvenience, GOD keep me, for his goodness!) I
submit me to be reconciled, and to be buxom and obedient unto these
Laws of GOD, and to every Article of them. For by authority specially
of these Laws, I will, through the grace of GOD, be unied</i> [united]

<p class="hang"><i>Yea, Sir, and over this, I believe and admit all the Sentences,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<i>authorities, and reasons of the Saints and Doctors, according unto
Holy Scripture, and declaring it truly. I submit me wilfully and
meekly to be ever obedient, after my cunning and power, to all these
Saints and Doctors as they are obedient in work and in word to GOD and
his Law: and further, not to my knowledge; nor for any earthly power,
dignity, or state, through the help of GOD.</i></p>

<p>"But, Sir, I pray you tell me, if after your bidding, I shall lay my
hand upon the book, to the intent to swear thereby?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said unto me, "Yea! wherefore else?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to him, "Sir, a book is nothing else but a thing
coupled together of diverse creatures [<i>created things</i>]; and to swear
by any creature, both GOD's Law and man's law is against. But, Sir,
this thing I say here to you, before these your Clerks, with my
foresaid <i>Protestation</i>, that how, where, when, and to whom, men are
bounden to swear or to obey, in any wise, after GOD's Laws, and Saints
and good Doctors according with GOD's Law; I will, through GOD's
grace, be ever ready thereto, with all my cunning and power!</p>

<p>"But I pray you, Sir, for the charity of GOD! that ye will, before
that I swear as I have rehearsed to you, tell me how or whereto that I
shall submit me; and shew me whereof that ye will correct me, and what
is the ordinance that ye will thus oblige me to fulfil?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said unto me, "I will, shortly, that
now thou swear here to me, that thou shalt forsake all the opinions
which the Sect of Lollards hold, and is slandered [<i>charged</i>] with; so
that, after this time, neither privily nor apertly, thou hold any
opinion which I shall, after that thou hast sworn, rehearse to thee
here. Nor thou shalt favour no man nor woman, young nor old, that
holdeth any of these foresaid opinions; but, after thy knowledge and
power, thou shalt enforce thee to withstand all such distroublers of
Holy Church in every diocese that thou comest in; and them that will
not leave their false and damnable opinions, thou shalt put them up,
publishing them and their names; and make them known to the Bishop of
the diocese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> that they are in, or to the Bishop's Ministers. And, over
this, I will that thou preach no more, unto the time that I know, by
good witness and true, that thy conversation be such that thy heart
and thy mouth accord truly in one contrarying [of] all the lewd
learning that thou hast taught herebefore."</p>

<p>And I, hearing these words, thought in my heart that this was an
unlawful asking; and I deemed myself cursed of GOD, if I consented
hereto: and I thought how <span class="smcap">Susanna</span> said, <i>Anguish is to me on every
side!</i></p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And in that I stood still, and spake not; the Archbishop
said to me, "Answer one wise or another!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">He is to be the Bishops' spy.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, if I consented to you thus, as ye have here
rehearsed to me; I should become an Appealer, or every Bishop's Spy!
Summoner of all England! For an [<i>if</i>] I should thus put up and
publish the names of men and women, I should herein deceive full many
persons: yea, Sir, as it is likely, by the doom of my conscience, I
should herein be cause of the death, both of men and women; yea, both
bodily and ghostly. For many men and women that stand now in the
Truth, and are in the way of salvation, if I should for the learning
and reading of their <i>Belief</i> publish them or put them therefore up to
Bishops or to their unpiteous Ministers, I know some deal by
experience, that they should be so distroubled and dis-eased with
persecution or otherwise, that many of them, I think, would rather
choose to forsake the Way of Truth than to be travailed, scorned, and
slandered or punished as Bishops and their Ministers now use [<i>are
accustomed</i>] for to constrain men and women to consent to them.</p>

<p>"But I find in no place in Holy Scripture, that this office that ye
would now enfeoff me with, accordeth to any priest of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s sect,
nor to any other Christian man. And therefore to do thus, were to me a
full noyous bond to be bounden with, and over grievous charge. For I
suppose that if I thus did, many men and women in the world, yea, Sir,
might justly, unto my confusion say to me that 'I were a traitor to
GOD and to them!' since, as I think in mine heart, many men and women
trust so mickle in me in this case, that I would not, for the saving
of my life, do thus to them. For if I thus should do, full many men
and women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> would, as they might full truly, say that 'I had falsely
and cowardly forsaken the Truth, and slandered shamefully the Word of
GOD!' For if I consented to you, to do hereafter your will, for
bonchief and mischief that may befall to me in this life, I deem in my
conscience that I were worthy herefore to be cursed of GOD, as also of
all His Saints! From which inconvenience keep me and all Christian
people, Almighty GOD! now and ever, for His holy name!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Arundell threatens to burn William.</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And then the Archbishop said unto me, "O thine heart is
full hard, endured [<i>hardened</i>] as was the heart of <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span>; and the
Devil hath overcome thee, and perverted thee! and he hath so blinded
thee in all thy wits, that thou hast no grace to know the truth, nor
the measure of mercy that I have proffered to thee! Therefore, as I
perceive now by thy foolish answer, thou hast no will to leave thine
old errors. But I say to thee, lewd losell! [<i>base lost one!</i> or <i>base
son of perdition!</i>] either thou quickly consent to mine ordinance, and
submit thee to stand to my decrees, or, by Saint Thomas! thou shalt be
disgraded [<i>degraded</i>], and follow thy fellow in Smithfield!"</p>

<p>And at this saying, I stood still and spake not; but I thought in mine
heart that GOD did to me a great grace, if He would, of His great
mercy, bring me to such an end. And in mine heart, I was nothing
[a]fraid with this menacing of the Archbishop.</p>

<p>And I considered, there, two things in him. One, that he was not yet
sorrowful, for that he had made <span class="smcap">William Sautre</span> wrongfully to be burnt
[<i>on Feb. 12, 1401, at Smithfield</i>]. And as I considered that the
Archbishop thirsted yet after more shedding out of innocent blood. And
fast therefore I was moved in all my wits, for to hold the Archbishop
neither for Prelate, nor for priest of GOD; and for that mine inward
man was thus altogether departed from the Archbishop, methought I
should not have any dread of him. But I was right heavy and sorrowful
for that there was none audience of secular [<i>lay</i>] men by: but in
mine heart, I prayed the LORD GOD to comfort me and strengthen me
against them that there were against the Soothfastness. And I purposed
to speak no more to the Archbishop and his Clerks [<i>Chaplains</i>] than
me need behoved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">How William came to Wycliffe, about 1377.</span></div>

<p>And all thus I prayed GOD, for His goodness, to give me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> then and
always grace to speak with a meek and an easy spirit; and whatsoever
thing that I should speak, that I might thereto have true authorities
of Scriptures and open reason.</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And for that I stood still, and nothing spake, one of the
Archbishop's Clerks said unto me, "What thing musest thou? Do thou, as
my Lord hath now commanded to thee here!"</p>

<p>And yet I stood still, and answered him not.</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And then, soon after, the Archbishop said to me, "Art thou
not yet bethought, whether thou wilt do as I have here said to thee?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said then to him, "Sir, my father and mother (on whose
souls GOD have mercy! if it be His will) spent mickle money in divers
places about my learning; for the intent to have made me a priest to
GOD. But when I came to years of discretion, I had no will to be
priest; and therefore my friends were right heavy to me. And then
methought their grudging against me was so painful to me, that I
purposed therefore to have left their company. And when they perceived
this in me, they spake some time full fair and pleasant words to me:
but for that they might not make me to consent, of good heart, to be a
priest, they spake to me full ofttimes very grievous words, and
menaced me in divers manners, shewing to me full heavy cheer. And
thus, one while in fair manner, another while in grievous, they were
long time, as methought, full busy about me, ere I consented to them
to be a priest.</p>

<p>"But, at the last, when, in this matter, they would no longer suffer
mine excusations; but either I should consent to them, or I should
ever bear their indignation; yea, 'their curse,' as they said. Then I
seeing this, prayed them that they would give me license for to go to
them that were named wise priests and of virtuous conversation, to
have their counsel, and to know of them the office and the charge of
priesthood.</p>

<p>"And hereto my father and my mother consented full gladly, and gave me
their blessing and good leave to go, and also money to spend in this
journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wycliffe's co-workers in translating the <i>Bible</i>, Hereford
&amp; Purvey, give up Lollardism.</span></div>

<p>"And so then I went to those priests whom I heard to be of best name
and of most holy living, and best learned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> most wise of heavenly
wisdom: and so I communed with them unto the time that I perceived, by
their virtuous and continual occupations, that their honest and
charitable works [sur]passed their fame, which I heard before of them.
Wherefore, sir, by the example of the doctrine of them, and specially
for the godly and innocent works which I perceived of them and in
them; after my cunning and power I have exercised me then, and in this
time, to know perfectly GOD's Law: having a will and desire to live
thereafter, willing that all men and women exercised themselves
faithfully thereabout.</p>

<p>"If then, Sir, either for pleasure or displeasure of them that are
neither so wise, nor of so virtuous conversation (to my knowledge, nor
by common fame of other men's knowledge in this land) as these men
were, of whom I took my counsel and information; I should now forsake,
thus suddenly and shortly, and unwarned, all the learning that I have
exercised myself in, this thirty winter [<i>i.e., from 1377</i>] and more,
my conscience should ever be herewith out of measure unquieted. And
as, Sir, I know well that many men and women should be therethrough
greatly troubled and slandered; and (as I said, Sir, to you before)
for mine untruth and false cowardness many a one should be put into
full great reprefe [<i>reproof</i>]. Yea, Sir, I dread that many a one, as
they might then justly, would curse me full bitterly: and, Sir, I fear
not but the curse of GOD (which I should deserve herein) would bring
me to a full evil end, if I continued thus.</p>

<p>"And if through remorse of conscience, I repented me at any time,
returning into the Way which you do your diligence to constrain me now
to forsake; yea, Sir, all the Bishops of this land, with full many
other priests, would defame me, and pursue me as a Relapse: and they
that now have (though I be unworthy) some confidence in me, hereafter
would never trust to me, though I could teach and live never so
virtuously more that I can or may.</p>

<p>"For if, after your counsel, I left utterly all my Learning: I should
hereby, first wound and defile mine own soul; and also I should
herethrough give occasion to many men and women of full sore hurting.
Yea, Sir, it is likely to me, if I consented to your will, I should
herein by mine evil example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> in it, as far as in me were, slay many
folk ghostly, that I should never deserve for to have grace of GOD to
the edifying of His Church, neither of myself, nor of none other man's
life, and [be] undone both before GOD and man.</p>

<p>"But, Sir, by example chiefly of some, whose names I will not now
rehearse, [<span class="smcap">Nicholas de] H[ereford</span>], of <span class="smcap">J[ohn] P[urvey</span>], and <span class="smcap">B[owland</span>];
and also by the present doing of <span class="smcap">Philip</span> of <span class="smcap">Repington</span> that [<i>after
being a Lollard</i>] is now become Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> [<i>consecrated on
March 28, 1405; and about a year following this Examination was made,
on September 19, 1408, a Cardinal</i>]: I am now learned, as many more
hereafter through GOD's grace shall be learned, to hate and to flee
all such slander that these foresaid men chiefly hath defiled
principally themselves with. And in it that in them is, they have
envenomed all the Church of GOD; for the slanderous revoking at the
Cross of Paul's, of <span class="smcap">H[ereford</span>], <span class="smcap">P[urvey</span>], and of <span class="smcap">B[owland</span>], and how
now <span class="smcap">Philip Repington</span> pursueth <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s people. And the feigning that
these men dissemble by worldly prudence, keeping them cowardly in
their preaching and communing, within the bonds and terms, which,
without blame, may be spoken and shewed out to the most worldly
livers, will not be unpunished of GOD. For to the point of truth that
these men shewed out some time, they not will now stretch forth their
lives: but by example, each one of them, as their words and works
shew, they busy them, through their feigning, for to slander and to
pursue <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in his members, rather than they will be pursued."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "These men the which thou
speakest of now, were fools and heretics, when they were counted wise
men of thee and other such losells: but now they are wise men, though
thou and such others deem them unwise. Nevertheless, I wist never
none, that right said; that any while were envenomed with your
contagiousness, that is contaminated and spotted doctrine."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to the Archbishop, "Sir, I think well that these
men and such others are now wise as to this world, but as their words
sounded sometime and their works shewed outwardly, it was likely to
move me that they had earnest of the wisdom of GOD, and that they
should hav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>e deserved mickle grace of GOD to have saved their own
souls and many other men's, if they had continued faithful in wilful
poverty and in other simple virtuous living; and specially if they had
with these foresaid virtues, continued in their busy fruitful sowing
of GOD's Word, as, to many men's knowledge, they occupied them a
season in all their wits full busily to know the pleasant Will of GOD,
travailing all their members full busily for to do thereafter purely,
and chiefly to the praising of the most holy name of GOD and for grace
of edification and salvation of Christian people. But woe worth false
covetise! and evil counsel! and tyranny! by which they and many men
and women are led blindly into an evil end."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">J. Purvey, Vicar of West Hythe</span>, 1401-3.</div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "Thou and such other
losells of thy sect would shave your beards full near, for to have a
benefice! For, by Jesu! I know none more covetous shrews than ye are,
when that ye have a benefice. For, lo, I gave to <span class="smcap">John Purvey</span> a
benefice but a mile out of this Castle [<i>i.e., the vicarage of West
Hythe, near Saltwood Castle in Kent, which <span class="smcap">Purvey</span> held from August 11,
1401, till he resigned it on October 8, 1403</i>], and I heard more
complaints about his covetousness for tithes and other misdoings, than
I did of all men that were advanced within my diocese."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to the Archbishop, "Sir, <span class="smcap">Purvey</span> is neither with
you now for the benefice that ye gave him, nor holdeth he faithfully
with the learning that he taught and writ before time; and thus he
sheweth himself neither to be hot nor cold: and therefore he and his
fellows may sore[ly] dread that if they turn not hastily to the Way
that they have forsaken, peradventure they be put out of the number of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s chosen people."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Though <span class="smcap">Purvey</span> be now a false
harlot [<i>debased man. This term was at this time applied also to
men</i>], I quite me [<i>absolve myself in respect</i>] to him: but come he
more for such cause before me, ere we depart, I shall know with whom
he holdeth! But I say to thee, Which are these holy men and wise of
whom thou hast taken thine information?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The first leaders of the Lollards.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, Master <span class="smcap">John Wycliffe</span> was holden of full
many men, the greatest Clerk [<i>Divine</i>] that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> knew then living;
and therewith he was named a passing ruely man and an innocent in his
living: and herefore great many commoned [<i>communed</i>] oft with him,
and they loved so much his learning that they writ it, and busily
enforced them to rule themselves thereafter. Therefore, Sir, this
foresaid learning of Master <span class="smcap">John Wycliffe</span> is yet holden of full many
men and women, the most agreeable learning unto the living and
teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles, and most openly shewing and
declaring how the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> hath been, and yet should be, ruled
and governed. Therefore so many men and women covet this learning, and
purpose, through GOD's grace, to conform their living like to this
learning of <span class="smcap">Wycliffe</span>.</p>

<p>"Master <span class="smcap">John Aiston</span> taught and writ accordingly, and full busily,
where, and when, and to whom that he might: and he used it himself
right perfectly, unto his life's end.</p>

<p>"And also <span class="smcap">Philip</span> of <span class="smcap">Repington</span>, while he was a Canon of Leicester [<i>He
was Chancellor of Oxford in 1397, and again in 1400</i>]; <span class="smcap">Nicholas
Her[e]ford; David Gotray</span> of Pakring, Monk of Bylande and a Master of
Divinity; and <span class="smcap">John Purvey</span>, and many others, which were holden right
wise men and prudent, taught and writ busily this foresaid learning,
and conformed them thereto. And with all these men I was oft right
homely [<i>quite at home</i>], and communed with them long time and oft:
and so, before all other men, I choose wilfully to be informed of them
and by them, and especially of <span class="smcap">Wycliffe</span> himself; as of the most
virtuous and godly wise men that I heard of or knew. And therefore of
him specially, and of these men I took my learning, that I have
taught; and purpose to live thereafter, if GOD will! to my life's end.</p>

<p>"For though some of these men be contrary to the learning that they
taught before, I wot well that their learning was true which they
taught; and therefore, with the help of GOD, I purpose to hold and to
use the learning which I heard of them while they sat on <span class="smcap">Moses</span>' chair,
and specially while they sat on the chair of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. But after the
works that they now do, I will not do! with GOD's help. For they feign
and hide and contrary the Truth which before they taught out plainly
and truly. For as I know well, when some of these men hath been blamed
for their slanderous doing, they grant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> not that they have taught
amiss, or erred before time; but that they were constrained by pain[s]
to leave to tell out the Sooth: and thus they choose now rather to
blaspheme GOD than to suffer awhile here bodily persecution for
Soothfastness that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shed out his heart-blood for."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William's Sermon at St. Chad's.</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "That learning that thou callest
Truth and Soothfastness is open slander to Holy Church, as it is
proved of Holy Church. For albeit that <span class="smcap">Wycliffe</span> your author
[<i>founder</i>] was a great Clerk, and though that many men held him a
perfect liver: yet his doctrine is not approved of Holy Church, but
many Sentences of his learning are damned [<i>condemned</i>] as they are
well worthy.</p>

<p>"But as touching <span class="smcap">Philip</span> of <span class="smcap">Repington</span> that was first Canon, and after
Abbot of Leicester, which is now Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>; I tell thee that
the Day is now comen for which he fasted the Even! For neither he
holdeth now, <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'now'">nor</ins> will hold the learning that he thought when he was
Canon of Leicester; for no Bishop of this land pursueth now more
sharply them that hold thy Way than he doth."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, full many men and women wondereth upon him,
and speaketh him mickle shame, and holdeth him for a cursed enemy of
the Truth."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Wherefore tarriest thou me
thus here, with such fables? Wilt thou shortly, as I said to thee,
submit thee to me or no?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I tell you at one word. I dare not, for the
dread of GOD, submit me to you after the tenour and Sentence that ye
have above rehearsed to me."</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And then, as if he had been wroth, he said to one of his
Clerks, "Fetch hither quickly the <i>Certification</i> that came to me from
Shrewsbury, under the Bailiff's seal, witnessing the errors and
heresies which this losell hath venemously witnessed there!"</p>

<p>Then hastily the Clerk took out and laid forth on a cupboard divers
rolls and writings; among which there was a little one, which the
Clerk delivered to the Archbishop.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The desire of the Shrewsbury men.</span></div>

<p>And by and by the Archbishop read this roll containing this sentence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><img src="images/symbol.png"  alt="&para;" /> <i>The third Sunday</i> [April 17th] <i>after Easter</i> [March 27th], <i>the
year of our Lord 1407, <span class="smcap">William Thorpe</span> came unto the town of
Shrewsbury, and, through leave granted to him to preach, he said
openly in St. Chad's Church, in his sermon,</i></p>

<div class="indent"><i>That the Sacrament of the Altar after the consecration was material bread.</i><br />
<i>And that images should in no wise be worshipped.</i><br />
<i>And that men should not go on any pilgrimages.</i><br />
<i>And that priests have no title to tithes.</i><br />
<i>And that it is not lawful to swear in any wise.</i></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And when the Archbishop had read thus this roll, he rolled
it up again, and said to me, "Is this wholesome learning to be among
the people?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to him, "Sir, I am both ashamed on their behalf,
and right sorrowful for them that have certified you these things thus
untruly: for I never preached nor taught thus, privily nor apertly."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "I will give credence to
these worshipful men which have written to me and witnessed under
their seals there among them. Though thou now deniest this, weenest
thou that I will credence to thee! Thou, losell! hast troubled the
worshipful comminalty of Shrewsbury, so that the Bailiffs and
comminalty of that town have written to me, praying me, that am
Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, Primate, and Chancellor of England, <i>that I
will vouchsafe to grant them, that if thou shalt be made, as thou art
worthy! to suffer open jouresse</i> [? penance or pillory] <i>for thine
heresies, that thou may have thy jouresse openly there among them; so
that all they whom thou and such like losells have there perverted,
may, through fear of thy deed</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, martyrdom] <i>be reconciled
again to the unity of Holy Church; and also they that stand in true
faith of Holy Church may through thy deed be more stablished
therein.</i>" And as if this asking had pleased the Archbishop, he said,
"By my thrift! this hearty prayer and fervent request shall be thought
on!"</p>

<p>But certainly neither the prayer of the men of Shrewsbury, nor the
menacing of the Archbishop made me anything afraid: but, in the
rehearsing of this malice, and in the hearing of it, my heart greatly
rejoiced, and yet doth. I thank GOD, for the grace that I then
thought, and yet think, shall come to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> the Church of GOD
herethrough, by the special merciful doing of the LORD.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A dauntless Lollard speech.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And as having no dread of the malice of tyrants, by trusting
stedfastly in the help of the LORD, with full purpose for to
[ac]knowledge the Soothfastness, and to stand thereby after my cunning
and power, I said to the Archbishop, "Sir, if the truth of GOD's Word
might now be accepted as it should be, I doubt not to prove by likely
evidence, that they that are famed to be out of the faith of Holy
Church in Shrewsbury and in other places also, are in the true faith
of Holy Church. For as their words sound and their works shew to man's
judgement, dreading and loving faithfully GOD; their will, their
desire, their love, and their business, are most set to dread to
offend GOD and to love for to please Him in true and faithful keeping
of His commandments.</p>

<p>"And again, they that are said to be in the faith of Holy Church at
Shrewsbury and in other places, by open evidence of their proud,
envious, malicious, covetous, lecherous, and other foul words and
works, neither know nor have will to know nor to occupy their wits
truly and effectuously in the right faith of Holy Church. Wherefore
[none of] all these, nor none that follow their manners, shall any
time come verily in the faith of Holy Church, except they enforce them
more truly to come in the way which now they despise. For these men
and women that are now called Faithful and holden Just, neither know,
nor will exercise themselves to know, of faithfulness, one commandment
of GOD. And thus full many men and women now, and specially men that
are named to be "principal limbs of Holy Church," stir GOD to great
wrath; and deserve His curse for that they call or hold them "just
men" which are full unjust, as their vicious words, their great
customable swearing, and their slanderous and shameful works shew
openly and witness. And herefore such vicious men and unjust in their
own confusion call them "unjust men and women," which after their
power and cunning, busy themselves to live justly after the
commandment of GOD.</p>

<p>"And where, Sir, ye say, that I have distroubled the comminalty of
Shrewsbury and many other men and women with my teaching; if it thus
be, it is not to be wondered [at] of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> wise men, since all the
comminalty of the city of Jerusalem was distroubled of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s own
person, that was Very GOD and Man, and [the] most prudent preacher
that ever was or shall be. And also all the Synagogue of Nazareth was
moved against <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and so full-filled with ire towards him for his
preaching, that the men of the Synagogue rose up and cast <span class="smcap">Christ</span> out
of their city, and led him up to the top of a mountain for to cast him
down there headlong. Also according hereto, the LORD witnesseth by
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, that He shall put dissension betwixt His people, and the people
that contrarieth and pursueth His people. Who, Sir, is he that shall
preach the truth of GOD's Word to that unfaithful people, and shall
let [<i>hinder</i>] the Soothfastness of the gospel, and the prophecy of
GOD Almighty to be fulfilled?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "It followeth of these thy
words, that thou, and such other, thinkest that ye do right well for
to preach and teach as ye do, without authority of any Bishop. For ye
presume that the LORD hath chosen you only, for to preach as faithful
disciples and special followers of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The office of every Priest is to preach.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, by authority of GOD's law, and also of
Saints and Doctors, I am learned to deem that it is every priest's
office and duty for to preach busily, freely, and truly the Word of
GOD.</p>

<p>"For, no doubt, every priest should purpose first in his soul and
covet to take the order of priesthood chiefly for to make known to the
people the Word of GOD, after his cunning and power, approving his
words ever to be true by his virtuous works; and for this intent we
suppose that Bishops and other prelates of Holy Church should chiefly
take and use their prelacy. And for the same cause, Bishops should
give to priests their orders. For Bishops should accept no man to
priesthood, except that he had good will and full purpose, and were
well disposed and well learned to preach. Wherefore, Sir, by the
bidding of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and by example of His most holy living, and also by
the witnessing of His holy apostles and prophets, we are bound under
full great pain to exercise us after our cunning and power (as every
priest is likewise charged of GOD), to fulfil duly the office of
priesthood. We presume not hereof, ourselves, for to be esteemed,
neither in our own reputation nor in none other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> man's, faithful
disciples and special followers of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>: but, Sir, as I said to you
before, we deem this, by authority chiefly of GOD's Word, that it is
the chief duty of every priest to busy him faithfully to make the law
of GOD known to His people; and so to comune [<i>communicate</i>] the
commandment of GOD charitably, how that we best, where, when, and to
whom that ever we may, is our very duty. And for the will and business
that we owe of due debt to do justly our office, through the stirring
and special help, as we trust, of GOD, hoping stedfastly in His mercy,
we desire to be the faithful disciples of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>: and we pray this
gracious LORD, for His holy name! that He make us able for to please
Him with devout prayers and charitable priestly works, that we may
obtain of Him to follow Him thankfully."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Lewd losell! whereto
makest thou such vain reasons to me? Asketh not Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>How
should priests preach, except they be sent?</i> But I sent thee never to
preach! For thy venomous doctrine is so known throughout England, that
no Bishop will admit thee for to preach, by witnessing of their
Letters! Why then, lewd idiot! willst thou presume to preach, since
thou art not sent nor licensed of thy Sovereign to preach? Saith not
Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> that <i>Subjects owe</i> [ought] <i>to obey their Sovereigns;
and not only good and virtuous, but also tyrants that are vicious!</i>"</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOD <span class="smcap">will be a Letter of License!</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to the Archbishop, "Sir, as touching your Letter
of License or other Bishops', which, ye say, we should have to witness
that we were able to be sent for to preach; we know well that neither
you, Sir, nor any other Bishop of this land will grant to us any such
Letters of License but [<i>except</i>] we should oblige [<i>bind</i>] us to you
and to other Bishops by unlawful oaths for to pass not the bounds and
terms which ye, Sir, or other Bishops will limit to us. And since in
this matter, your terms be some too large, and some too strait; we
dare not oblige us thus to be bound to you for to keep the terms which
you will limit to us, as ye do to Friars and such other preachers: and
therefore, though we have not your Letter, Sir, nor Letters of other
Bishops written with ink upon parchment; we dare not herefore leave
the office of preaching; to which preaching, all priests, after their
cunning and power are bound, by divers testimonies of GOD's Law and of
great Doctors, without any mention making of Bishops' Letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Both good and bad are witnesses.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>"For as mickle as we have taken upon us the office of priesthood,
though we are unworthy thereto, we come and purpose to fulfil it, with
the help of GOD, by authority of His own law, and by witness of great
Doctors and Saints according hereto, trusting stedfastly in the mercy
of GOD. For that [<i>because</i>] He commandeth us to do the office of
priesthood, He will be our sufficient Letters and witness, if we, by
the example of his living and teaching specially occupy us faithfully
to do our office justly: yea, that people to whom we preach, be they
faithful or unfaithful, shall be our Letters, that is, our witness
bearers; for that Truth where it is sown may not be unwitnessed. For
all that are converted and saved by learning of GOD's Word and by
working thereafter are witness bearers, that the Truth and
Soothfastness which they heard and did after, is cause of their
salvation. And again, all unfaithful men and women which heard the
Truth told out to them and would not do thereafter, also all they that
might have heard the Truth and would not hear it, because that they
would not do thereafter, all these shall bear witness against
themselves, and the Truth (which they would not hear, or else heard it
and despised to do thereafter through their unfaithfulness) is and
shall be cause of their damnation.</p>

<p>"Therefore, Sir, since this foresaid witnessing of GOD, and of divers
Saints and Doctors, and of all the people good and evil sufficeth to
all true preachers: we think that we do not the office of the
priesthood, if that we leave our preaching because that we have not or
may not have duly Bishops' Letters to witness that we are sent of them
to preach. This Sentence approveth Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> where he speaketh of
himself and of faithful Apostles and disciples, saying thus, <i>We need
no letters of commendation as some other preachers do; which preach
for covetousness of temporal goods, and for men's praising.</i></p>

<p>"And where ye say, Sir, Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> biddeth <i>subjects obey their
Sovereigns</i>; this is Sooth, and may not be denied. But there are two
manner of Sovereigns; virtuous sovereigns and vicious tyrants.
Therefore to these last Sovereigns, neither men nor women that be
subject owe [<i>ought</i>] to obey. In two manners. To virtuous Sovereigns
and charitable, subjects owe to obey wilfully and gladly in hearing of
their good counsel, in consenting to their charitable biddings, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in working after their fruitful works. This Sentence, <span class="smcap">Paul</span> approveth
where he saith thus to subjects, <i>Be ye mindful of your Sovereigns
that speak to you the Word of GOD; and follow you the faith of them,
whose conversation you know to be virtuous.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The old theory of Political Responsibility.</span></div>

<p>"For as <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith after, These Sovereigns to whom subjects owe to
obey in following of their manners, work busily in holy studying how
they may withstand and destroy vices, first in themselves and after in
all their subjects, <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'and and'">and</ins> how they may best plant in them virtues. Also
these Sovereigns make devout and fervent prayers for to purchase
[<i>obtain</i>] grace of GOD, that they and their subjects may, over all
things, dread to offend Him, and to love for to please Him. Also these
Sovereigns to whom <span class="smcap">Paul</span> biddeth us obey, as it is said before, live so
virtuously that all they that will live well may take of them good
example to know and to keep the commandments of GOD.</p>

<p>"But, in this foresaid wise, subjects owe [<i>ought</i>] not to obey nor to
be obedient to tyrants, while they are vicious tyrants; since their
will, their counsel, their biddings, and their works are so vicious
that they owe [<i>ought</i>] to be hated and left. And though such tyrants
be masterful and cruel in boasting and menacing, in oppressions and
divers punishings; Saint <span class="smcap">Peter</span> biddeth the servants of such tyrants to
obey meekly to such tyrants, suffering patiently their malicious
cruelness. But <span class="smcap">Peter</span> counselleth not any servant or subject to obey to
any Lord, or Prince, or Sovereign, in anything that is not pleasing to
GOD."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said unto me, "If the Sovereign bid his
subject do that thing that is vicious, this Sovereign herein is to
blame: but the subject, for his obedience, deserveth meed of GOD. For
obedience pleaseth more to GOD than any sacrifice."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "<span class="smcap">Samuel</span> the Prophet said to <span class="smcap">Saul</span> the wicked King,
that <i>GOD was more pleased with the obedience of His commandment, than
with any sacrifice of beasts</i>: but <span class="smcap">David</span> saith, and Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> and
Saint <span class="smcap">Gregory</span> accordingly together, that not only they that do evil
are worthy of death and damnation; but also all they that consent to
evil doers. And, Sir, the law of Holy Church teacheth, in the
<i>Decrees</i>, that no servant to his Lord, nor child to the father or
mother, nor wife to her husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> nor monk to his abbot, ought to
obey, except in lefull [<i>loyal</i>] things and lawful."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "All these allegings that
thou bringest forth are nought else but proud presumptuousness. For
hereby thou enforcest [<i>endeavourest</i>] thee to prove, that thou and
such others are so just, that ye owe [<i>ought</i>] not to obey to
Prelates: and thus against the learning of Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> that telleth you
<i>not to preach, but if ye were sent</i>, of your own authority, ye will
go forth and preach, and do what ye list!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, [re]presenteth not every priest the office
of the Apostles or the office of the disciples of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Yea!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Priest not preaching, is Antichrist.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, as the 10th Chapter of Matthew and the last
Chapter of Mark witnesseth, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> sent his Apostles for to preach.
And the 10th Chapter of Luke witnesseth <span class="smcap">Christ</span> sent his two and
seventy disciples for to preach in every place that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was to come
to. And Saint <span class="smcap">Gregory</span> in the <i>Common Law</i> saith, that every man that
goeth to priesthood taketh upon him the office of preaching: for as he
saith, <i>that priest stirreth GOD to great wrath, of whose mouth is not
heard the voice of preaching</i>. And as other more glosses upon <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>
witness, that the priest that preacheth not busily to the people shall
be partaker of their damnation, that perish through his default: and
though the people be saved by other special grace of GOD than by the
priest's preaching; yet the priests (in that they are ordained to
preach, and preach not) as before GOD, they are man-slayers. For as
far as in them is, such priests as preach not busily and truly,
slayeth all the people ghostly, in that they withhold from them the
Word of GOD, that is [the] life and sustenance of men's souls. And
Saint <span class="smcap">Isidore</span> saith, <i>Priests shall be damned for</i> [the] <i>wickedness
of the people, if they teach not them that are ignorant, and condemn
them that are sinners</i>. For all the work and witness of priests
standeth in preaching and teaching; that they edify all men, as well
by cunning of faith, as by discipline of works, that is virtuous
teaching. And, as the gospel witnesseth, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> said in his teaching,
<i>I am born and come into this world to bear witness to the Truth, and
he that is of the Truth heareth my voice.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"<img src="images/symbol.png"  alt="&para;" /> Then, Sir,
since by the word of Christ specially, that is his
voice, priests are commanded to preach; whatsoever priest that it be,
that hath not goodwill and full purpose to do thus, and ableth not
himself after his cunning and power to do his office, by the example
of Christ and his Apostles: whatsoever other thing that he doeth,
displeaseth GOD. For, lo, Saint <span class="smcap">Gregory</span> saith, <i>That thing left, that
a man is bound chiefly to do; whatsoever other thing that a man doeth,
it is unthankful to the HOLY GHOST.</i> And therefore saith [<span class="smcap">Robert
Grosset&ecirc;te</span>, Bishop of] <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>, <i>That priest that preacheth not the
Word of GOD, though he be seen to have none other default, he is
Antichrist and Sathanas, a night-thief and a day-thief, a slayer of
souls, and an angel of light turned into darkness.</i></p>

<p>"Wherefore, Sir, these authorities and others well considered, I deem
myself damnable, if I, either for pleasure or displeasure of any
creature, apply me not diligently to preach the Word of GOD: and in
the same damnation, I deem all those priests which, of good purpose
and will, enforce them not busily to do thus, and also all them that
have purpose or will to let [<i>hinder</i>] any priest of this business."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The <i>Psalter</i> taken from William.</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to those three Clerks that stood
before him, "Lo, Sirs, this is the manner and business of this losell
and such others, to pick out such sharp sentences of Holy Scripture
and of Doctors to maintain their sect and lore [<i>teaching</i>] against

covetest to have again the <i>Psalter</i> that I made to be taken from thee
at Canterbury, to record sharp verses against us! But thou shalt never
have that <i>Psalter</i>, nor none other book, till that I know that thy

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, all my will and power is, and ever shall
be, I trust to GOD! to be governed by Holy Church."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop asked me, "What was Holy Church?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I told you before, what was Holy Church:
but since ye ask me this demand, I call <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his saints, Holy

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said unto me, "I wot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> well that
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his saints are Holy Church in heaven; but what is Holy Church in
earth?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, though Holy Church be every one in charity;
yet it hath two parts. The first and principal part hath overcomen
perfectly all the wretchedness of this life, and reigneth joyfully in
heaven with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. And the other part is here yet in earth, busily
and continually fighting, day and night, against temptations of the
Fiend, forsaking and hating the prosperity of this world, despising
and withstanding their fleshly lusts; which only are the pilgrims of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, wandering towards heaven by steadfast faith, and grounded
hope, and by perfect charity. For these heavenly pilgrims may not, nor
will not, be letted [<i>hindered</i>] of their good purpose by reason of
any Doctors discording from Holy Scripture, nor by the floods of any
tribulation temporal, nor by the wind of any pride of boast, or of
menacing of any creature; for they are all fast grounded upon the sure
stone <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, hearing his word and loving it, exercising them
faithfully and continually in all their wits to do thereafter."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to his Clerks, "See ye not how his

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop took the <i>Certification</i> in his hand,

<p>"As I stood there in the pulpit, busying me to teach the commandment

turned away hastily, and with great noise ran from towards me. And I
seeing this, say to them thus, 'Good men! ye were better to stand here
full still and to hear GOD's Word. For, certes, the virtue and the
mede of the most holy Sacrament of the Altar standeth much more in the
Belief thereof that ye ought to have in your soul, than it doth in the
outward Sight thereof. And therefore ye were better to stand quietly
to hear GOD's Word, because that through the hearing thereof, men come
to very true belief.' And otherwise, Sir, I am certain I spake not

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "How teachest thou men to

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, as I believe myself, so I teach other men."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "It is sooth, that this

sect teachest it to be the substance of bread! Think you this true
teaching?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Neither I nor any other of the sect that ye damn

Canon of the <i>Masse</i>, after the consecration, this most worthy
Sacrament is called <i>holy bread</i>. And every priest in this land, after

may receive, through very belief, this holy Sacrament worthily.' And,
Sir, Saint <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> saith, <i>That thing that is sense is bread, but
that men's faith asketh to be informed of, is very <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body.</i> And

sentence, with the <i>Secret</i> of the fourth ferye <i>quatuor temporum

believe that this most worthy Sacrament of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s own body is one
Accident without Subject. But, Sir, for as mickle as your asking
passeth mine understanding, I dare neither deny it nor grant it, for
it is a School matter [<i>a subject for debate in the University

I commit this term <i>accidens sine subjecto</i>, to those Clerks which
delight them so in curious and subtle sophistry, because they

thee, by worthy men of Shrewsbury, saying that thou preachedst openly
there that <i>the images ought not to be worshipped in any wise</i>?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I preached never thus, nor, through GOD's
grace, I will not, any time, consent to think nor to say thus; neither
privily, nor apertly. For, lo, the LORD witnesseth by Moses, that the
things which He made were <i>right good</i>, and so then they were, and yet
are, and shall be good and worshipful in their kind. And thereto, to
the end that GOD made them to, they are all preisable [<i>valuable</i>] and
worshipful; and specially man that was made after the image and
likeness of GOD is full worshipful in his kind: yea, this holy image,
that is man, GOD worshippeth [<i>respecteth</i>]. And herefore every man
should worship others in kind, and also for heavenly virtues that men
use charitably. Also I say, wood, tin, gold, silver, or any other
matter that images are made of; all these creatures [<i>created things</i>]
are worshipful in their kind, and to the end that GOD made them for.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">How Image-carvers shrive themselves first.</span></div>

<p>"But the carving, casting, nor painting of any imagery made with man's
hands (albeit that this doing be accepted of men of highest state and
dignity, and ordained of them to be a calendar [<i>horn book</i>] to lewd
men that neither can nor will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> be learned to know GOD in His Word,
neither by His creatures, nor by His wonderful and divers workings);
yet this imagery ought not to be worshipped in the form, nor in the
likeness of man's craft: nevertheless that every matter that painters
paint with, since it is GOD's creature, ought to be worshipped in the
kind and to the end that GOD made and ordained it to serve man."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "I grant well that nobody
oweth [<i>ought</i>] to do worship to any such images for themselves; but a
crucifix ought to be worshipped for the Passion of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> that is
painted therein, and so brought therethrough to man's mind: and thus
the images of the blessed Trinity and of [the] Virgin <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s
mother, and other images of the saints ought to be worshipped. For,
lo, earthly kings and lords, which use to send their letters ensealed
with their arms or with their privy signet, to men that are with them,
are worshipped of these men. For when these men receive their lord's
letters, in which they see and know the wills and biddings of their
lords, in worship of their lords, they do off their caps to these
letters: why not, then, since in images made with man's hands, we may
read and know many divers things of GOD and of His saints, shall we
not worship their images?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, with my foresaid Protestation, "I say that these
worldly usages of temporal lords that ye speak now of, may be done in
case without sin: but this is no similitude to worship images made by
man's hand, since that <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, <span class="smcap">David</span>, <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, <span class="smcap">Baruch</span>, and other saints
in the <i>Bible</i>, forbid so plainly the worshipping of all such images."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "Lewd losell! In the Old
Law, before that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> took mankind [<i>human nature</i>], was no likeness
of any person of the Trinity neither shewed to man nor known of man;
but now since <span class="smcap">Christ</span> became man, it is lawful to have images to shew
His manhood. Yea, though many men which are right great Clerks, and
others also, hold it an error to paint the Trinity; I say, it is well
done to make and to paint the Trinity in images. For it is a great
moving of devotion to men, to have and to behold the Trinity and other
images of Saints carved, cast, and painted. For beyond the sea, are
the best painters that ever I saw. And, sirs! I tell you, this is
their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> manner; and it is a good manner! When that an image-maker shall
carve, cast in mould, or paint any images; he shall go to a priest,
and shrive him as clean as if he should die, and take penance, and
make some certain vow of fasting, or of praying, or of pilgrimages
doing: praying the priest specially to pray for him, that he may have
grace to make a fair and a devout image."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Great boldness of the Lollard Apostle.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I doubt not, if these painters that ye
speak of, or any other painters understood truly the text of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, of
<span class="smcap">David</span>, of the Wise Man [<i>i.e.</i>, <i><span class="smcap">Solomon</span></i>], of <span class="smcap">Baruch</span>, and of other
Saints and Doctors, these painters should be moved to shrive them to
GOD, with full inward sorrow of heart; taking upon them to do right
sharp penance for the sinful and vain craft of painting, carving, or
casting that they had used; promising GOD faithfully never to do so
after, [ac]knowledging openly before all men, their reprovable
earning. And also, sir, these priests, that shrive, as ye do say,
painters, and enjoin them to do penance, and pray for their speed,
promising to them help of their prayers for to be curious [<i>cunning</i>]
in their sinful crafts, sin herein more grievously than the painters.
For these priests do comfort and give them counsel to do that thing,
which of great pain (yea, under the pain of GOD's curse!) they should
utterly forbid them. For, certes, Sir, if the wonderful working of
GOD, and the holy living and teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and of his Apostles
and Prophets were made known to the people by holy living and true and
busy teaching of priests; these things, Sir, were sufficient books and
kalendars to know GOD by, and His Saints: without any images made with
man's hand: but, certes, the vicious living of priests and their
covetousness are [the] chief cause of this error and all other
viciousness that reigneth among the people."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "I hold thee a vicious
priest, and a curst! and all them that are of thy sect! for all
priests of Holy Church and all images that move men to devotion; thou
and such others go about to destroy! Losell! were it a fair thing to
come into a church, and see therein none image?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">There is no miracle in an Image.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, they that come to the church, for to pray
devoutly to the LORD GOD, may in their inward wits be the more fervent
[when] that all their outward wits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> be closed from all outward seeing
and hearing and from all distroublance and lettings [<i>hindrances</i>].
And since <span class="smcap">Christ</span> blessed them that saw him not bodily, and have
believed faithfully in him: it sufficeth then, to all men, through
hearing and knowing of GOD's Word, and to do thereafter, for to
believe in GOD, though they see never images made with man's hands,
after any Person of the Trinity, or of any other Saint."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me with a fervent spirit, "I
say to thee, losell! that it is right well done to make and to have an
image of the Trinity! Yea, what sayest thou? Is it not a stirring
thing to behold such an image?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, ye said, right now, that in the Old Law,
ere Christ took mankind, no likeness of any Person of the Trinity was
shewed to men; wherefore, Sir, ye said it was not then lawful to have
images: but now ye say, since <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is become man, it is lawful to
make and to have an image of the Trinity, and also of other saints.
But, sir, this thing would I learn of you! Since the Father of heaven,
yea, and every Person of the Trinity was, without beginning, GOD
Almighty, and many holy prophets, that were dedely [<i>deathly, i.e.,
liable to death</i>] men, were martyrized violently in the Old Law, and
also many men and women then died holy Confessors: why was it not
<i>then</i>, as lawful and necessary as now, to have made an image of the
Father of heaven, and to have made and had other images of martyrs,
prophets, and holy confessors to have been kalendars to advise men and
move them to devotion, as ye say that images now do?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "The Synagogue of Jews had not
authority to approve these things, as the Church of Christ hath now."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, Saint <span class="smcap">Gregory</span> was a great man in the New
Law, and of great dignity; and as the Common [? <i>Canon</i>] Law
witnesseth, he commended greatly a Bishop, in that he forbade utterly
the images made with man's hand, should be worshipped."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">In what image, may GOD be shewed?</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Ungracious losell! thou
favourest no more the truth, than a hound! Since at the Rood[s] at the
North Door [<i>of Saint Paul's Church</i>] at London, at our Lady at
Walsingham, and many other divers places in England, are many great
and preisable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> [<i>precious</i>] miracles done: should not the images of
such holy saints and places, at [<i>on account of</i>] the reverence of
GOD, and our Lady, and other saints, be more worshipped, than other
places and images where no such miracles are done?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, there is no such virtue in any imagery,
that any images should herefore be worshipped; wherefore I am certain
that there is no miracle done of GOD in any place in earth, because
that any images made with man's hand, should be worshipped. And
herefore, Sir, as I preached openly at Shrewsbury and other places, I
say now here before you: that nobody should trust that there were any
virtue in imagery made with man's hand, and herefore nobody should vow
to them, nor seek them, nor kneel to them, nor bow to them, nor pray
to them, nor offer anything to them, nor kiss them, nor incense them.
For, lo, the most worthy of such images, the Brazen Serpent, by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>
made, at GOD's bidding! the good King <span class="smcap">Hezekiah</span> destroyed worthily and
thankfully; for because it was incensed. Therefore, Sir, if men take
good heed to the writing and to the learning of Saint <span class="smcap">Augustine</span>, of
Saint <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>, and of Saint John <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>, and of other Saints and
Doctors, how they speak and write of miracles that shall be done now
in the last end of the world; it is to dread that, for the
unfaithfulness of men and women, the Fiend hath great power for to
work many of the miracles that now are done in such places. For both
men and women delight now, more for to hear and know miracles, than
they do to know GOD's Word or to hear it effectuously. Wherefore, to
the great confusion of all them that thus do, Christ saith, <i>The
generation of adulterers requireth tokens, miracles, and wonders.</i>
Nevertheless, as divers Saints say, now, when the faith of GOD is
published in Christendom, the Word of God sufficeth to man's
salvation, without such miracles; and thus also the Word of GOD
sufficeth to all faithful men and women, without any such images.</p>

<p>"But, good Sir, since the Father of heaven, that is GOD in His
Godhead, is the most unknown thing that may be, and the most wonderful
Spirit, having in it no shape or likeness of any members of any dedely
[<i>deadly, i.e., liable to death</i>] creature: in what likeness, or what
image, may GOD the Father be shewed or painted?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "As Holy Church hath suffered,
and yet suffereth the images of all the Trinity, and other images to
be painted and shewed, sufficeth to them that are members of Holy
Church. But since thou art a rotten member cut away from Holy Church,
thou favourest not the ordinance thereof! But since the day passeth,
leave we this matter!"</p>

certified you of me, I told at Shrewsbury of two manner of
pilgrimages."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Whom callest thou true
pilgrims?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Every good thought is a step heavenward.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, with my Protestation, I call them true
pilgrims travelling towards the bliss of heaven, which (in the state,
degree, or order that GOD calleth them) do busy them faithfully for to
occupy all their wits bodily and ghostly, to know truly and keep
faithfully the biddings of GOD, hating and fleeing all the seven
deadly sins and every branch of them, ruling them virtuously, as it is
said before, with all their wits, doing discreetly wilfully and gladly
all the works of mercy, bodily and ghostly, after their cunning and
power abling them to the gifts of the HOLY GHOST, disposing them to
receive in their souls, and to hold therein the right blessings of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>; busying them to know and to keep the seven principal virtues:
and so then they shall obtain herethrough grace for to use thankfully
to GOD all the conditions of charity; and then they shall be moved
with the good Spirit of GOD for to examine oft and diligently their
conscience, that neither wilfully nor wittingly they err in any
Article of Belief, having continually (as frailty will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> suffer) all
their business to dread and to flee the offence of GOD, and to love
over all things and to seek ever to do His pleasant will.</p>

<p>"Of these pilgrims, I said, 'Whatsoever good thought that they any
time think, what virtuous word that they speak, and what fruitful work
that they work; every such thought, word, and work is a step numbered
of GOD towards Him into heaven. These foresaid pilgrims of GOD delight
sore, when they hear of saints or of virtuous men and women, how they
forsook wilfully the prosperity of this life, how they withstood the
suggestion of the Fiend, how they restrained their fleshly lusts, how
discreet they were in their penance doing, how patient they were in
all their adversities, how prudent they were in counselling of men and
women, moving them to hate all sin and to flee them and to shame ever
greatly thereof, and to love all virtues and to draw to them,
imagining how <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his followers (by example of him) suffered
scorns and slanders, and how patiently they abode and took the
wrongful menacing of tyrants, how homely they were and serviceable to
poor men to relieve and comfort them bodily and ghostly after their
power and cunning, and how devout they were in prayers, how fervent
they were in heavenly desires, and how they absented them from
spectacles of vain seeings and hearings, and how stable they were to
let [<i>hinder</i>] and to destroy all vices, and how laborious and joyful
they were to sow and plant virtues. These heavenly conditions and such
others, have the pilgrims, or endeavour them for to have, whose
pilgrimage GOD accepteth.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The singing and jangling of pilgrims.</span></div>

<p>"And again I said, 'As their works shew, the most part of men or women
that go now on pilgrimages have not these foresaid conditions; nor
loveth to busy them faithfully for to have. For (as I well know, since
I have full oft assayed) examine, whosoever will, twenty of these
pilgrims! and he shall not find three men or women that know surely a
Commandment of GOD [<i>i.e., one of the Ten Commandments</i>], nor can say
their <i>Pater noster</i> and <i>Ave <span class="smcap">Maria</span></i>! nor their <i>Credo</i>, readily in
any manner of language. And as I have learned, and also know somewhat
by experience of these same pilgrims, telling the cause why that many
men and women go hither and thither now on pilgrimages, it is more for
the health of their bodies, than of their souls! more for to have
richesse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> prosperity of this world, than for to be enriched with
virtues in their souls! more to have here worldly and fleshly
friendship, than for to have friendship of GOD and of His saints in
heaven. For whatsoever thing a man or woman doth, the friendship of
GOD, nor of any other Saint, cannot be had without keeping of GOD's
commandments.'</p>

<p>"For with my Protestation, I say now, as I said at Shrewsbury, 'though
they that have fleshly wills, travel for their bodies, and spend
mickle money to seek and to visit the bones or images, as they say
they do, of this saint and of that: such pilgrimage-going is neither
praisable nor thankful to GOD, nor to any Saint of GOD; since, in
effect, all such pilgrims despise GOD and all His commandments and
Saints. For the commandments of GOD they will neither know nor keep,
nor conform them to live virtuously by example of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and of his
Saints.'</p>

<p>"Wherefore, Sir, I have preached and taught openly, and so I purpose
all my lifetime to do, with GOD's help, saying that 'such fond people
waste blamefully GOD's goods in their vain pilgrimages, spending their
goods upon vicious hostelars [<i>innkeepers</i>], which are oft unclean
women of their bodies; and at the least, those goods with the which,
they should do works of mercy, after GOD's bidding, to poor needy men
and women.'</p>

<p>"<img src="images/symbol.png"  alt="&para;" /> These poor men's goods and their livelihood, these runners about
offer to rich priests! which have mickle more livelihood than they
need: and thus those goods, they waste wilfully, and spend them
unjustly, against GOD's bidding, upon strangers; with which they
should help and relieve, after GOD's will, their poor needy neighbours
at home. Yea, and over this folly, ofttimes divers men and women of
these runners thus madly hither and thither into pilgrimage, borrow
hereto other men's goods (yea, and sometimes they steal men's goods
hereto), and they pay them never again.</p>

<p>"Also, Sir, I know well, that when divers men and women will go thus
after their own wills, and finding out one pilgrimage, they will
ordain with them before[hand] to have with them both men and women
that can well sing wanton songs; and some other pilgrims will have
with them bagpipes: so that every town that they come through, what
with the noise of their singing, and with the sound of their piping,
and with the jangling of their Canterbury bells, and with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> barking
out of dogs after them, they make more noise than if the King came
there away, with all his clarions and many other minstrels. And if
these men and women be a month out in their pilgrimage, many of them
shall be, a half year after, great janglers, tale-tellers, and liars."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Archbp.'s cure for a toeache.</span></div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Lewd losell! thou seest
not far enough in this matter! for thou considerest not the great
travail of pilgrims; therefore thou blamest that thing that is
praisable! I say to thee, that it is right well done; that pilgrims
have with them both singers and also pipers: that when one of them
that goeth barefoot striketh his toe upon a stone and hurteth him sore
and maketh him to bleed; it is well done, that he or his fellow, begin
then a song or else take out of his bosom a bagpipe for to drive away
with such mirth, the hurt of his fellow. For with such solace, the
travail and weariness of pilgrims is lightly and merrily brought
forth."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> teacheth men, <i>to weep with them

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "What janglest thou against men's
devotion? Whatsoever thou or such other say, I say, that the
pilgrimage that now is used, is to them that do it, a praisable and a
good mean[s] to come the rather to grace. But I hold thee unable to
know this grace! for thou enforcest thee to let [<i>hinder</i>] the
devotion of the people, since by authority of Holy Scripture, men may
lawfully have and use such solace as thou reprovest! For <span class="smcap">David</span> in his
last <i>Psalm</i>, teacheth me to have divers instruments of music for to
praise therewith GOD."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, by the sentence [<i>opinions</i>] of divers
Doctors expounding the <i>Psalms</i> of <span class="smcap">David</span>, the music and minstrelsy
that <span class="smcap">David</span> and other Saints of the Old Law spake of, owe [<i>ought</i>],
now, neither to be taken nor used by the letter; but these instruments
with their music ought to be interpreted ghostly [<i>spiritually</i>]: for
all those figures are called Virtues and Grace, with which virtues men
should please GOD and praise His name. For Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith, <i>All such
things befell to them in figure.</i> Therefore, Sir, I understand that
the letter of this <i>Psalm</i> of <span class="smcap">David</span> and of such other <i>Psalms</i> and
sentences, doth slay them that taken them now literally. This
sentence, I understand, Sir, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>proveth himself, putting out
the minstrels, ere that he would quicken the dead damsel."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Lewd losell! is it not
lawful for us to have organs in the church, for to worship therewithal
GOD?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Yea, Sir, by man's ordinance; but, by the
ordinance of GOD, a good sermon to the people's understanding, were
mickle more pleasant to GOD!"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said that "organs and good delectable
songs quickened and sharpened more men's wits, than should any
sermon!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> But I said, "Sir, lusty men and worldly lovers delight and
covet and travail to have all their wits quickened and sharpened with
divers sensible solace: but all the faithful lovers and followers of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> have all their delight to hear GOD's Word, and to understand it
truly, and to work thereafter faithfully and continually. For, no
doubt, to dread to offend GOD, and to love to please Him in all
things, quickeneth and sharpeneth all the wits of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s chosen
people, and ableth them so to grace, that they joy greatly to withdraw
their ears, and all their wits and members from all worldly delight,
and from all fleshly solace. For Saint <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>, as I think, saith,
<i>Nobody may joy with this world, and reign with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</i>"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop, as if he had been displeased with mine

<p>"And I said to him, 'Sir, in this town, are many Clerks and Priests;

Seculars. Therefore, ask ye of them this question!'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"And this man said to me, 'Sir, our prelates say that we are also
obliged to pay our tithes of all things that renew to us; and that
they are accursed that withdraw any part wittingly from them of their
tithes.'</p>

before you, that 'I had wonder[ed] that any priest dare say <i>men to be
accursed</i>, without ground of GOD's Word.'</p>

<p>"And the man said, 'Sir, our priests say that they curse men thus, by
authority of GOD's Law.'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'Sir, I know not where this sentence of cursing is
authorized now in the <i>Bible</i>. And therefore, Sir, I pray you that ye
will ask the most cunning Clerk of this town, that ye may know where
this sentence, "cursing them that tythe not now," is written in GOD's

[<i>informed</i>] where.'</p>

<p>"But, shortly, this man would not go from me, to ask this question of
another body; but required me, there, as I would answer before GOD!
if, in this case, the cursing of priests were lawful and approved of
GOD?</p>

<p>"And, shortly, therewith came to my mind the learning of Saint <span class="smcap">Peter</span>,
teaching priests especially, <i>to hallow the LORD <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in their
hearts, being evermore ready, as far as in them is, to answer through
faith and hope, to them that ask of them a reason</i>. And this lesson
<span class="smcap">Peter</span> teacheth me to use, with a meek spirit, and with dread of the
LORD.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, Sir, I said to this man, in this wise, 'In the Old Law,
which ended not fully till the time that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> rose up again from
death to life, GOD commanded tithes to be given to the Levites for the
great business and daily travail that pertained to their office: but
Priests, because their travail was mickle more easy and light than was
the office of the Levites, GOD ordained that Priests should take for
their lifelode [<i>livelihood</i>] to do their office, the tenth part of
those tithes that were given to the Levites.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Apostle Paul worked with his hands.</span></div>

<p>"'But now,' I said, 'in the New Law, neither <span class="smcap">Christ</span> nor any of his
Apostles took tithes of the people, nor commanded the people to pay
tithes, neither to Priests nor to Deacons. But <span class="smcap">Christ</span> taught the
people to do almesse [<i>alms</i>], that is, works of mercy to poor needy
men, of surplus that is superfluouse [<i>superfluity</i>] of their temporal
goods which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> they had more than them needed reasonably to their
necessary livelihood. And thus,' I said, 'not of tithes, but of pure
alms of the people <span class="smcap">Christ</span> lived and his Apostles, when they were so
busy in teaching of the Word of GOD to the people, that they might not
travail otherwise for to get their livelihood. But after <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s
Ascension, and when the Apostles had received the HOLY GHOST, they
travailed with their hands for to get their livelihood when that they
might thus do for [<i>on account of</i>] busy preaching. Therefore, by
example of himself, St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span> teacheth all the priests of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> for to
travail with their hands, when for busy teaching of the people, they
might thus do. And thus all these priests (whose priesthood GOD
accepteth now, or will accept; or did [accept] in the Apostles' time,
and after their decease) will do, to the world's end.</p>

<p>"'But as <i>Cisterciensis</i> telleth, in the thousand year of our Lord
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, two hundred and eleventh year, one Pope, the tenth
<span class="smcap">Gregory</span>, ordained new tithes first to be given to priests now in the
New Law. But Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> in his time (whose trace or example, all
priests of GOD enforce them to follow), seeing the covetousness that
was among the people (desiring to destroy this foul sin, through the
grace of GOD, and true virtuous living and example of himself) wrote
and taught all priests for <i>to follow him, as he followed <span class="smcap">Christ</span></i>,
patiently, willingly, and gladly in high poverty. Wherefore <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith
this, <i>The LORD hath ordained, that they that preach the Gospel shall
live by the Gospel. But we,</i> saith <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>that covet and busy us to be
faithful followers of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, use not this power.</i> For, lo, as <span class="smcap">Paul</span>
witnessed afterward, when he was full poor and needy, preaching among
the people, he was not chargeous [<i>chargeable</i>] unto them, but with
his hands he travailed, not only to get his own living, but also the
living of other poor and needy creatures. And since the people were
never so covetous nor so avarous [<i>avaricious</i>], I guess, as they are
now; it were good counsel that all priests took good heed to this
heavenly learning of <span class="smcap">Paul</span>: following him here, in wilful poverty,
nothing charging the people for their bodily livelihood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Priests spend the parish offerings.</span></div>

<p>"'But because that many priests do contrary <span class="smcap">Paul</span> in this foresaid
doctrine, <span class="smcap">Paul</span> biddeth the people take heed to those priests, that
follow him, as he had given them example: as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> would say thus
to the people, "Accept ye none other priests, than they that live
after the form that I have taught you!" For, certain, in whatsoever
dignity or order that any priest is in, if he conform him not to
follow <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles in wilful poverty and in other heavenly
virtues, and specially in true preaching of GOD's Word; though such a
one be named a Priest, yet he is no more but a Priest in name: for the
work of a very Priest such a one wanteth! This sentence [<i>opinion</i>]
approveth <span class="smcap">Augustine</span>, <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>, <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>, and [<span class="smcap">Grosset&ecirc;te</span>, <i>Bishop
of</i>] <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> plainly.'"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Thinkest thou this
wholesome learning for to sow openly, or yet privily among the people!
Certain, this doctrine contrarieth plainly the ordinance of Holy
Fathers: which have ordained, granted, and licensed priests to be in
divers degrees; and to live by tithes and offerings of the people, and
by other duties."</p>

give them freely sufficient livelihood."</p>

now, by the law, every priest can scarcely constrain the people to

contrary to <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His Apostles. And therefore the people are full
heavy to pay, as they do, their temporal goods to Parsons and to other
Vicars and Priests; which should be faithful dispensators of the
parish's goods, taking to themselves no more but a scarce living of
tithes nor of offerings by the Ordinance of the Common Law. For
whatsoever priests take of the people, be it tithes or offering, or
any other duty or service, the priests ought not to have thereof no
more but a bare living: and to depart [<i>give away</i>] the residue to the
poor men and women, specially of the parish of whom they take this
temporal living.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> But the most deal [<i>greater portion</i>] of priests now
waste their parish's goods, and spendeth them at their own will, after
the world in their vain lusts: so that in few places poor men have
duly, as they should have, their own sustenance, neither of tithes nor
of offerings, nor of other large wages and foundations that priests
take of the people in divers manners, above that they need for needful
sustenance of meat and clothing. But the poor needy people are
forsaken and left of priests, to be sustained of the paroshenis
[<i>parishioners</i>]; as if the priests took nothing of the parishioners,
for to help the poor people with. And thus, Sir, into over great
charges of the parishioners, they pay their temporal goods twice;
where once might suffice, if priests were true dispensators.</p>

<p>"Also, Sir, the parishioners that pay their temporal goods, be they
tithes or offerings, to priests that do not their office among them
justly, are partners of every sin of those priests: because that they
sustain those priests' folly in their sin, with their temporal goods.
If these things be well considered, what wonder is it then, Sir, if
the parishioners grudge against these dispensators?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "Thou that shouldest be
judged and ruled by Holy Church, presumptuously, thou deemest Holy
Church to have erred in the ordinance of tithes and other duties to be
paid to priests! It shall be long ere thou thrive, losell! that thou
despisest thy ghostly Mother! How darest thou speak this, losell!
among the people? Are not tithes given to priests for to live by?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith that tithes were given in
the Old Law to Levites and to Priests, that came of the lineage of
<span class="smcap">Levi</span>. But <i>our priest</i>, he saith, <i>came not of the lineage of <span class="smcap">Levi</span>,
but of the lineage of <span class="smcap">Judah</span>; to which <span class="smcap">Judah</span>, no tithes were promised
to be given</i>. And therefore <span class="smcap">Paul</span> saith, <i>Since the priesthood is
changed from the generation of <span class="smcap">Levi</span> to the generation of <span class="smcap">Judah</span>, it is
necessary that changing also be made of the Law</i>. So that priests live
now without tithes and other duties that they now claim; following
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles in wilful poverty, as they have given them
example. For since <span class="smcap">Christ</span> lived all the time of His preaching by pure
[<i>the simple</i>] alms of the people, and (by example of him) his
Apostles lived in the same wise, or else by the travail of their
hands, as it is said above; every priest, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> priesthood <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
approveth, knoweth well, and confesseth in word and in work that <i>a
disciple oweth</i> [ought] <i>not to be above his Master, but it sufficeth
to a disciple to be as his Master</i>, simple and pure, meek and patient:
and by example specially of his Master <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, every priest should
rule him in all his living; and so, after his cunning and power, a
priest should busy him to inform and to rule whomsoever he might
charitably."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, with a great spirit, "GOD's
curse have thou and thine for this teaching! for thou wouldest hereby
make the Old Law more free and perfect than the New Law! For thou
sayest it is lawful for Levites and to Priests to take tithes in the
Old Law, and so to enjoy their privileges; but to us priests in the
New Law, thou sayest it is not lawful to take tithes! And thus, thou
givest the Levites of the Old Law more freedom, than to priests of the
New Law!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I marvel, that ye understand this plain
text of <span class="smcap">Paul</span> thus! Ye wot well, that the Levites and Priests in the
Old Law, that took tithes, were not so free nor so perfect as <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
and his Apostles that took no tithes! And, Sir, there is a Doctor, I
think that it is Saint <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>, that saith thus, <i>The priests that
challenge now in the New Law, tithes, say, in effect that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is
not become Man, nor that he hath yet suffered death for man's love.</i>
Whereupon, this Doctor saith this sentence, <i>Since tithes were the
hires and wages limited to Levites and to Priests of the Old Law, for
bearing about of the Tabernacle, and for slaying and flaying of
beasts, and for burning of sacrifice, and for keeping of the Temple,
and for trumping of battle before the host of Israel, and other divers
observances that pertained to their office; those priests, that will
challenge or take tithes, deny that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is comen in flesh, and do
the Priest's office of the Old Law, for whom tithes were granted: for
else</i>, as the Doctor saith, <i>priests take now tithes wrongfully</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<span class="smcap">Heard ye ever losell speak thus!</span>"</div>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to his Clerks, "Heard ye ever
losell speak thus! Certain, this is the learning of them all, that
wheresoever they come, and they may be suffered, they enforce them to
expugn the freedom of Holy Church!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, why call you the taking of tithes and of
such other duties that priests challenge now wrongfully 'the freedom
of Holy Church'; since neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Christ</span> nor his Apostles challenged nor
took such duties? Herefore these takings of priests now, are not
called justly 'the freedom of Holy Church': but all such giving and
taking ought to be called and holden 'the slanderous covetousness of
men of the Holy Church.'"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Why, losell! wilt not thou
and others that are confedered [<i>confederated</i>] with thee, seek out of
Holy Scripture and of the sentence of Doctors, all sharp authorities
against Lords and Knights and Squires, and against other secular men,
as thou dost against priests?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><span class="smcap">Priests are the stomach of the people!</span></i></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, whatsoever men or women, Lords or Ladies,
or any others that are present in our preaching specially, or in our
communing, after our cunning, we to tell to them their office and
their charges: but, Sir, since <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> saith <i>the priests are the
stomach of the people</i>, it is needful in preaching and also in
communing, to be most busy about this priesthood, since by the
viciousness of priests, both Lords and Commons are most sinfully
infected and led into the worst. And because that the covetousness of
priests, and pride and the boast that they have and make, of their
dignity and power, destroyeth not only the virtues of priesthood in
priests themselves: but also, over this, it stirreth GOD to take great
vengeance both upon Lords and Commons, which suffer these priests
charitably."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Thou judgest every priest
proud that will not go arrayed as thou dost! By God! I deem him to be
more meek that goeth every day in a scarlet gown, than thou, in that
threadbare blue gown! Whereby knowest thou a proud man?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, a proud priest may be known when he denieth
to follow <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles in wilful poverty and other virtues;
and coveteth worldly worship, and taketh it gladly, and gathereth
together with pleting [? <i>pleading</i>] menacing or with flattering, or
with simony, any worldly goods: and most if a priest busy him not
chiefly in himself, and after in all other men and women, after his
cunning and power, to withstand sin."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Though thou knewest a
priest to have all these vices, and though thou sawest a priest,
lovely, lie now by a woman, knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> her fleshly; wouldest thou
herefore deem this priest damnable? I say to thee, that in the turning
about of thy hand, such a sinner may be verily repented!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I will not damn any man for any sin that I
know done or may be done; so that the sinner leaveth his sin! But, by
authority of Holy Scripture, he that sinneth thus openly, as ye shew
here, is damnable for doing of such a sin; and most specially a priest
that should be [an] example to all others for to hate and fly sin: and
in how short time that ever ye say, that such a sinner may be
repented, he oweth [<i>ought</i>] not, of him that knoweth his sinning, to
be judged verily repentant, without open evidence of great shame and
hearty sorrow for his sin. For whosoever, and specially a priest, that
useth pride, envy, covetousness, lechery, simony, or any other vices;
and sheweth not, as open evidence of repentance, as he hath given evil
example and occasion of sinning: if he continue in any such sin as
long as he may, it is likely that sin leaveth him and he not sin; and,
as I understand, such a one sinneth unto death, for whom nobody oweth
[<i>ought</i>] to pay, as Saint <span class="smcap">John</span> saith."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And a Clerk said to the Archbishop, "Sir, the longer that ye
appose him, the worse he is! and the more that ye busy you to amend
him, the waywarder he is! for he is of so shrewd a kind, that he
shameth not only to be himself a foul nest; but, without shame, he
busieth him to make his nest fouler!"</p>

then, he said to me, "Lo, it is here certified against thee,
that thou preachedst openly at Shrewsbury <i>that it is not lawful to
swear in any case</i>."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I preached never so openly, nor I have not
taught in this wise, in any place. But, Sir, as I preached in
Shrewsbury, with my Protestation I say to you now here, That by the
authority of the Gospel and of Saint <span class="smcap">James</span>, and by witness of divers
Saints and Doctors, I have preached openly, in one place or other,
that it is not lawful in any case to swear by any creature. And, over
this, Sir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> have also preached and taught, by the foresaid
authorities, that nobody should swear in any case, if that without
oath, in any wise, he that is charged to swear, might excuse him to
them that have power to compel him to swear in leful things and
lawful: but if a man may not excuse him without oath to them that have
power to compel him to swear, then he ought to swear only by GOD,
taking Him only, that is Soothfastness, for to witness the
soothfastness."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And then a Clerk asked me, "If it were not leful [<i>lawful</i>]
to a subject, at the bidding of his Prelate, for to kneel down and
touch the Holy Gospel book, and kiss it saying, <i>So help me, GOD! and
this holy doom!</i> for he should, after his cunning and power, do all
things, that his Prelate commandeth him?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to them, "Sirs, ye speak here full generally and
largely! What, if a Prelate commanded his subject to do an unlawful
thing, should he obey thereto?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "A subject ought not to
suppose that his Prelate will bid him do an unlawful thing. For a
subject ought to think that his Prelate will bid him do nothing but
that he will answer for before GOD, that it is lefull [<i>lawful</i>]: and
then, though the bidding of the Prelate be unlawful, the subject hath
no peril to fulfil it; since that he thinketh and judgeth that
whatsoever thing his Prelate biddeth him do, that is leful to him for
to do it."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Man of Law and a Master of Divinity</span>.</div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I trust not hereto! But to our first
purpose! Sir, I tell you that I was once in a gentleman's house, and
there were then two Clerks there, a Master of Divinity and a Man of
Law; which Man of Law was also communing in divinity. And among other
things, these men spake of oaths. And the Man of Law said, 'At the
bidding of his Sovereign which had power to charge him to swear, he
would lay his hand upon a book, and hear his charge; and if his
charge, to his understanding were unlawful, he would hastily withdraw
his hand from the book; and if he perceived his charge to be leful he
would hold still his hand upon the book, taking there only GOD to
witness that he would fulfil that leful charge after his power.' And
the Master of Divinity said then to him thus, 'Certain, he that layeth
his hand upon a book in this wise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> and maketh there a promise to do
that thing that he is commanded, is obliged there, by book oath, then,
to fulfil his charge. For, no doubt, he that chargeth him to lay his
hand thus upon a book, touching the book and swearing by it, and
kissing it, promising in this form, to do this thing or that, will say
and witness, that he that toucheth thus a book and kisseth it, hath
sworn upon that book; and all other men that see that men thus do, and
also all those that hear thereof in the same wise, will say and
witness that <i>this man hath sworn upon a book!</i> Wherefore,' the Master
of Divinity said, 'it was not leful, neither to give nor to take any
such charge upon a book! for every book is nothing else but divers
creatures [<i>created things</i>], of which it is made of: therefore to
swear upon a book, is to swear by creatures! and this swearing is ever
unleful.'</p>

<p>"This sentence witnesseth <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>, plainly blaming them greatly,
that bring forth a book for to swear upon, charging Clerks that in
nowise they constrain anybody to swear, whether they think a man to
swear true or false."</p>

<p>And the Archbishop and his Clerks scorned me, and blamed me greatly
for this saying. And the Archbishop menaced me with great punishment
and sharp, except I left this opinion of swearing.</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, this is not mine opinion; but it is the
opinion of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Saviour! and of Saint <span class="smcap">James</span>! and of <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>!
and of other divers Saints and Doctors!"</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop bad a Clerk read this <i>Homily</i> of <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>,
which <i>Homily</i> this Clerk held in his hand written in a roll; which
roll the Archbishop caused to be taken from my fellow at Canterbury:
and so then this Clerk read this roll, till he came to a clause where
<span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> saith that <i>it is sin, to swear well</i>.</p>

<p><b>A Clerk (? Malveren).</b> And then a Clerk, <span class="smcap">Malveren</span> as I guess, said to
the Archbishop, "Sir, I pray you wit of him, how that he understandeth
<span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> here, saying it to be <i>sin, to swear well</i>."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And so the Archbishop asked me, "How I understood here
<span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William to explain Chrysostom's <i>Homily</i>.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And, certain, I was somewhat afraid to answer hereto; for I
had not busied me to study about the sense hereof: but lifting up my
mind to GOD, I prayed Him, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> grace. And, as fast, as I thought how
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> said to his apostles, <i>When, for my name, ye shall be brought
before judges, I will give into your mouth, wisdom, that your
adversaries shall not against say</i> [gainsay]; and trusting faithfully
in the Word of GOD, I said, "Sir, I know well, that many men and women
have now swearing so in custom, that they know not, nor will not know
that they do evil for to swear as they do: but they think and say,
that they do well for to swear as they do; though they know well that
they swear untruly. For they say, 'They may by their swearing, though
it be false, [a]void blame or temporal harm; which they should have,
if they swore not thus.'</p>

<p>"And, Sir, many men and women maintain strongly that they swear well,
when that thing is sooth that they swear for.</p>

<p>"Also full many men and women say now that 'It is well done to swear
by creatures, when they may not (as they say) otherwise be believed.'</p>

<p>"And also full many men and women now say that 'It is well done to
swear by GOD and by our Lady, and by other Saints; for to have them in
mind!'</p>

<p>"But since all these sayings are but excusations [<i>excuses</i>] and sin,
methinketh, Sir, that this sentence of <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> may be alleged well
against all such swearers: witnessing that these sin grievously;
though they think themselves for to swear in this foresaid wise, well.
For it is evil done and great sin for to swear truth, when, in any
manner, a man may excuse him without oath."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said that "<span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> might be thus
understood."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And then a Clerk said to me, "Wilt thou tarry my Lord no

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "If <span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span> meant according to

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> Then he said to me, "Why wilt thou not swear, then, by the
Gospel of GOD, that is, GOD's Word; since it is all one to swear by
the Word of GOD and by GOD Himself?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, since I may not, now, otherwise be believed

may not be touched with man's hands!"</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And the Clerk said I fonded [<i>fooled</i>], and that I said not

<p><b>William.</b> And I asked this Clerk, "Whether it were more to read the

is not the Gospel for [<i>through</i>] reading of the letter, but for the
belief that men have in the Word of GOD; that it is the Gospel that we
believe, and not the letter we read: for because the letter that is
touched with man's hand is not the Gospel, but the sentence that is
verily believed in man's heart is the Gospel. For so Saint <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>
saith, <i>The Gospel, that is the virtue of GOD's Word is not in the</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<i>leaves of the book, but it is in the root of reason. Neither the

<p>"This sentence approveth Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, saying thus, <i>The Kingdom of GOD

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And the Clerk said to me, "Thou wouldst make us to fond with
thee! Say we not that the Gospels are written in the <i>Mass</i> book?"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, though men use [<i>are accustomed</i>] to say
thus, yet it is unperfect speech. For the principal part of a thing is
properly the whole thing: for, lo, man's soul that may not now be seen
here, nor touched with any sensible thing, is properly Man! And all
the virtue of a tree is in the root thereof, that may not be seen; for
do away with the root, and the tree is destroyed! And, Sir, as ye said
to me, right now, GOD and His Word are of one authority; and, Sir,

I was surely betrayed of a man that came to me in prison [? <i>at
Saltwood Castle</i>] on the Friday before, communing with me in this
matter of confession: and, certain, by his words, I thought that this
man came then to me of full fervent and charitable will. But now I
know, he came to tempt me and to accuse me. GOD forgive him, if it be
His holy will!</p>

<p>And with all mine heart, when I had thought thus, I said to this
Clerk, "Sir, I pray you that ye would fetch this man hither! and all
the words, as near as I can repeat them, which that I spake to him on
Friday in the prison, I will rehearse now here, before you all, and
before him."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And, as I guess, the Archbishop then said to me, "They
that are now here, suffice to repeat them. How saidest thou to him?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Talk on Confession, in Saltwood Castle.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, that man came and asked me of divers
things; and after his asking, I answered him, as I understood that
good was. And, as he shewed to me by his words, he was sorry for his
living in Court, and right heavy for his own vicious living, and also
for the viciousness of other men, and specially of priests' evil
living; and herefore, he said to me with a sorrowful heart, as I
guessed, that he purposed fully, within short time, for to leave the
Court, and busy him to know GOD's Law, and to conform all his life
hereafter.</p>

<p>"And when he had said to me these words, and others more, which I
would rehearse and [<i>if</i>] he were present, he prayed me to hear his
confession.</p>

<p>"And I said to him, 'Sir, wherefore come ye to me, to be confessed of
me? Ye wot well that the Archbishop putteth and holdeth me here, as
one unworthy either to give or to take any Sacrament of Holy Church!'</p>

<p>"And he said to me, 'Brother, I wot well, and so wot many others more,
that you and such others are wrongfully vexed; and herefore I will
common [<i>commune</i>] with you the more gladly.'</p>

<p>"And I said to him, 'Certain, I wot well that many men of this Court
[<i>i.e.</i>, <i>the Archbishop's</i>], and specially Priests of this household
[<i>Chaplains</i>], would be full evil a paid, both with you and me, if
they wist that ye were confessed of me!'</p>

<p>"And he said that he cared not therefore, for he had full little
affection in them! and, as methought, he spake these words and many
others of so good will and of so high desire for to have known and
done the pleasant Will of GOD.</p>

<p>"And I said then to him, as with my foresaid Protestation, I say to
you now here, 'Sir, I counsel you for to absent you from all evil
company, and to draw you to them that love and busy them to know and
to keep the precepts of GOD; and then the good Spirit of GOD will move
you for to occupy busily all your wits in gathering together of all
your sins, as far as ye can bethink you; shaming greatly of them, and
sorrowing heartily for them. Yea, Sir, the HOLY GHOST will then put in
your heart a good will and a fervent desire for to take and to hold a
good purpose, to hate ever and to fly, after your cunning and power,
all occasion of sin: and so then wisdom shall come to you from above,
lightening with divers beams of grace and of heavenly desire all your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
wits, informing you how ye shall trust stedfastly in the mercy of the
LORD, [ac]knowledging to Him only all your vicious living, praying to
Him ever devoutly of charitable counsel and continuance, hoping
without doubt that if ye continue thus busying you faithfully to know
and keep his biddings, that He will, for He only may, forgive you all
your sins!'</p>

<p>"And this man said then to me, 'Though GOD forgive men their sins, yet
it behoveth men to be assoiled [<i>absolved</i>] of priests, and to do the
penance that they enjoin them!'</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOD <span class="smcap">alone can forgive sins</span>!</div>

<p>"And I said to him, 'Sir, it is all one to assoil men of their sins,
and to forgive men their sins: wherefore since it pertaineth only to
GOD to forgive sin, it sufficeth in this case, to counsel men and
women for to leave their sin, and to comfort them that busy them thus
to do, for to hope stedfastly in the mercy of GOD. And againward,
priests ought to tell sharply to customable sinners, that if they will
not make an end of their sin, but continue in divers sins while that
they may sin, all such deserve pain without end. And herefore priests
should ever busy them to live well and holily, and to teach the people
busily and truly the Word of GOD; shewing to all folk, in open
preaching and in privy counselling, that the LORD GOD only forgiveth
sin. And therefore those priests that take upon them to assoil men of
their sins, blaspheme GOD; since that it pertaineth only to the LORD
to assoil men of all their sins. For, no doubt, a thousand years after
that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was man, no priest of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> durst take upon him to teach
the people, neither privily nor apertly, that they behoved needs to
come to be assoiled of them; as priests do now. But by authority of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s word, priests bound indured [<i>hardened</i>] customable sinners
to everlasting pains, [those] which, in no time of their living, would
busy them faithfully to know the biddings of GOD, nor to keep them.
And, again, all they that would occupy all their wits to hate and to
flee all occasion of sin, dreading over all things to offend GOD, and
loving for to please Him continually; to these men and women, priests
shewed how the LORD assoileth them of their sins. And thus <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
promised to confirm in heaven, all the binding and loosing that
priests, by authority of his Word, bind men in sin that are indured
therein; or loose them out of sin here upon earth that are verily
repentant.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>"And this man hearing these words, said that he 'might well in
conscience consent to this sentence. But,' he said, 'is it not needful
to the lay people that cannot thus do, to go shrive them to priests?'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Monk of Faversham's sermon.</span></div>

<p>"And I said, 'If a man feel himself so distroubled with any sin, that
he cannot by his own wit, avoid this sin without counsel of them that
are herein wiser than he; in such a case, the counsel of a good priest
is full necessary. And if a good priest fail, as they do now commonly,
in such a case; Saint <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> saith that a man may lefully comon
[<i>lawfully commune</i>] and take counsel of a virtuous secular man. But,
certain, that man or woman is overladen and too beastly, which cannot
bring their own sins into their mind, busying them night and day for
to hate and for to forsake all their sins, doing a sigh for them,
after their cunning and power. And, Sir, full accordingly to this
sentence, upon mid-Lenton Sunday, two years [<i>March 29, 1405</i>], as I
guess, now agone, I heard a Monk of Feversham, that men called
<span class="smcap">Moredom</span>, preach at Canterbury, at the Cross within Christchurch Abbey,
saying thus of Confession: <i>As through the suggestion of the Fiend,
without counsel of any other body than of themselves, many men and
women can imagine and find means and ways enough to come to pride, to
theft, to lechery, and to other divers vices: in contrary wise</i>, this
Monk said, <i>since the LORD GOD is more ready to forgive sin than the
Fiend is or may be of power to move anybody to sin, then whoever will
shame and sorrow heartily for their sins, [ac]knowledging them
faithfully to GOD, amending them after their power and cunning,
without counsel of any other body than of GOD and himself, through the
grace of GOD, all such men and women may find sufficient means to come
to GOD's mercy, and so to be clean assoiled of all their sins.</i>' This
sentence I said, Sir, to this man of yours, and the self words, as
near as I can guess."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Holy Church approveth not this
learning."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, Holy Church, of which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is head in
heaven and in earth, must needs approve this sentence. For, lo, hereby
all men and women may, if they will, be sufficiently taught to know
and to keep the commandments of GOD, and to hate and to fly
continually all occasion of sin, and to love and to seek virtues
busily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> and to believe in GOD stably, and to trust in His mercy
stedfastly, and so to come to perfect charity and continue therein
perseverantly: and more, the LORD asketh not of any man here now in
this life. And, certain, since <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> died upon the cross
wilfully to make men free; Men of the Church are too bold and too busy
to make men thrall! binding them 'under the pains of endless curse,'
as they say, to do many observances and ordinances, which neither the
living nor the teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, nor of his Apostles approveth."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And a Clerk said then to me, "Thou shewest plainly here thy
deceit, which thou hast learned of them that travail to sow popil
[<i>tares</i>] among wheat! But I counsel thee to go away clean from this
learning, and submit thee lowly to my Lord, and thou shalt find him
yet to be gracious to thee!"</p>

<p><b>Another Clerk.</b> And as fast, another Clerk said to me, "How wast thou
so bold at Paul's Cross in London, to stand there hard, with thy
tippet [<i>cape</i>] bounden about thine head, and to reprove in his
sermon, the worthy Clerk <span class="smcap">Alkerton</span>, drawing away all, that thou
mightest! Yea, and the same day at afternoon, thou meeting that worthy
Doctor in Watling street, calledst him, 'False flatterer, and
hypocrite!'"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William calls Alkerton, <i>Flatterer</i>!</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I think certainly, that there was no man
nor woman that hated verily sin and loved virtues, hearing the sermon
of the Clerk of Oxford, and also <span class="smcap">Alkerton</span>'s sermon, but they said, and
might justly say, that <span class="smcap">Alkerton</span> reproved the Clerk untruly, and
slandered him wrongfully and uncharitably. For, no doubt, if the
living and teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> chiefly and his Apostles be true, nobody
that loveth GOD and His Law will blame any sentence that the Clerk
then preached there; since, by authority of GOD's Word, and by
approved Saints and Doctors, and by open reason, this Clerk approved
all things clearly that he preached there."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And a Clerk of the Archbishop said to me, "His sermon was
false, and that he sheweth openly, since he dare not stand forth and
defend his preaching, that he then preached there."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Clerk at Oxford, a Lollard.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I think that he purposeth to stand
stedfastly thereby, or else he slandereth foully himself and many
others that have great trust that he will stand by the truth of the
Gospel. For I wot well his sermon is writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>ten both in Latin and in
English; and many men have it, and they set great price thereby. And,
Sir, if ye were present with the Archbishop [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>,
in whose presence he was then standing</i>] at Lambeth, when this Clerk
appeared; and were at his Answer before the Archbishop: ye wot well
that this Clerk denied not there his sermon; but, two days, he
maintained it before the Archbishop and his Clerks."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop or a Clerk.</b> And then the Archbishop, or one of his Clerks
said (I wot not which of them!), "That harlot [<i>at this time applied
to men also</i>] shall be met with, for that sermon. For no man but he,
and thou, and such other false harlots, praiseth any such preaching."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And then the Archbishop said, "Your cursed sect is busy,
and it joyeth right greatly to contrary and to destroy the privilege
and freedom of Holy Church."</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I know no men travail so busily as this
sect doth, which you reprove, to make rest and peace in Holy Church.
For pride, covetousness, and simony which distrouble most Holy Church,
this sect hateth and flyeth, and travaileth busily to move all other
men in like manner unto meekness and wilful poverty and charity, and
free ministring of the sacraments: this sect loveth, and useth, and is
full busy to move all other folks, thus to do. For these virtues owe
all members of Holy Church to their head, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>."</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> Then a Clerk said to the Archbishop, "Sir, it is far day, and
ye have far to ride to-night; therefore make an end with him, for he
will none make! But the more, Sir, that ye busy you for to draw him
towards you, the more contumax [<i>contumacious</i>] he is made, and the
further from you."</p>

<p><b>Malveren.</b> And then <span class="smcap">Malveren</span> said to me, "<span class="smcap">William</span>! kneel down, and pray
my Lord, of grace! and leave all thy fantasies, and become a child of
Holy Church!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I have prayed the Archbishop oft, and yet I
pray him, for the love of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>! that he will leave his indignation
that he hath against me; and that he will suffer me, after my cunning
and power, for to do mine office of priesthood, as I am charged of GOD
to do it. For I covet nought else, but to serve my GOD to His
pleasing, in the state that I stand in, and have taken me to."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "If, of good heart, thou
wilt submit thee now, here, meekly to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> ruled, from this time forth
by my counsel, obeying meekly and wilfully to mine ordinance, thou

to thee now, here, shortly; or deny it utterly!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William questions the Archbishop.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to the Archbishop, "Sir, owe [<i>ought</i>] we to
believe that <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> was and is Very GOD and Very Man?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Yea!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, owe we to believe that all <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s living
and his teaching is true in every point?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And he said, "Yea!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, owe we to believe that the living of the

which are written in the <i>Bible</i> for the health and salvation of GOD's
people?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And he said, "Yea!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, owe all Christian men and women, after
their cunning and power, for to conform their living to the teaching
specially of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and also to the teaching and living of his
Apostles and of Prophets, in all things that are pleasant to GOD, and
edification to His Church?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And he said, "Yea!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, ought the doctrine, the bidding, or the
counsel of anybody to be accepted or obeyed unto, except this counsel,
these biddings, or this counsel may be granted and affirmed by

Apostles and Prophets?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Other doctrine ought not
to be accepted, nor we owe not to obey to any man's bidding or
counsel; except we can perceive that this bidding or counsel accordeth
with the bidding and teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and of his Apostles and
Prophets?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William very firm; Abp. in a passion.</span></div>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, are not all the learning and biddings and
counsels of Holy Church means and healthful remedies to know, and to
withstand the privy suggestions and the apert temptations of the
Fiend; and also ways and healthful remedies to slay pride and all
other deadly sins and the branches of them; and sovereign means to
purchase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> grace, for to withstand and overcome all fleshly lusts and
movings?"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "Yea!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, whatsoever thing ye or any other body bid
or counsel me to do; according to this foresaid learning, after my
cunning and power, through the help of GOD, I will meekly, with all
mine heart, obey thereto!"</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said to me, "Submit thee then, now,
here, meekly and wilfully to the ordinance of Holy Church, which I
shall shew to thee!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, according as I have here, now before you,
rehearsed, I will now be ready to obey full gladly to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the Head
of all Holy Church, and to the learning and biddings and counsels of
every pleasing member of Him."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop striking with his hand fiercely upon a
cupboard, spake to me, with a great spirit, saying, "By Jesu! but if
thou leave such additions, obliging thee now here without any
exception to mine ordinance, ere that I go out of this place, I shall
make thee as sure as any thief that is in the prison of Lantern.
Advise thee now, what thou wilt do!" And then, as if he had been
angered, he went from the cupboard where he stood, to a window.</p>

<p>And then <span class="smcap">Malveren</span> and another Clerk came nearer me, and they spake to
me many words full pleasantly, and another while they menaced me and
counselled full busily to submit me, or else they said I should not
escape punishing over measure; for they said I should be degraded,
cursed, and burned, and so then damned!</p>

<p><b>Malveren and a Clerk.</b> "But now," they said, "thou mayest eschew all
these mischiefs, if thou will submit thee wilfully and meekly to this
worthy Prelate, that hath cure of thy soul! And for the pity of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>!" said they, "bethink thee, how great clerks [<span class="smcap">Philip de
Repington</span>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>, <span class="smcap">Hereford</span>, and <span class="smcap">Purvey</span> were, and yet
are; and also <span class="smcap">B[owton]</span> that is a well understanding man: which also
have forsaken and revoked all the learning and opinions that thou and
such others hold! Wherefore, since each of them is mickle wiser than
thou art; we counsel thee for the best, that, by the example of these
four Clerks, thou follow them, submitting thee as they did!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Chaplains try their hands on him.</span></div>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And one of the [Arch]bishop's Clerks said, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> there, that
"he heard <span class="smcap">Nicholas Hereford</span> say, that 'since he forsook and revoked
all the learning and opinions of the Lollards, he hath had mickle
greater favour and more delight to hold against them; than ever he had
to hold with them, while he held with them.'"</p>

<p><b>Malveren.</b> And therefore <span class="smcap">Malveren</span> said to me, "I understand and [<i>if</i>]
thou wilt take thee to a priest, and shrive thee clean, forsake all
such opinions, and take thy penance of my Lord here, for the holding
and teaching of them, within short time thou shalt be greatly
comforted in this doing!"</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said to the Clerks, that thus busily counselled me to
follow these foresaid men, "Sirs, if these men, of whom ye counsel me
to take example, had forsaken benefices of temporal profit and of
worldly worship, so that they had absented them and eschewed from all
occasions of covetousness and of fleshly lusts; and had taken them to
simple living and wilful poverty: they had herein given good example
to me and many others to have followed them. But now, since all these
four men have slanderously and shamefully done the contrary,
consenting to receive and to have and to hold temporal benefices,
living now more worldly and more fleshly than they did before,
conforming them to the manners of this world; I forsake them herein,
and in all their foresaid slanderous doing!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William rejects the Lollard turncoats.</span></div>

<p>"For I purpose, with the help of GOD into remission of all my sins and
of my foul cursed living, to hate and to fly privily and apertly, to
follow these men! teaching and counselling whomsoever that I may, for
to fly and eschew the way that they have chosen to go in, which will
lead them to the worst end, if, in convenient time, they repent them
not, verily forsaking and revoking openly the slander that they have
put, and every day yet put to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s Church. For, certain, so open
blasphemy and slander, as they have spoken and done in their revoking
and forsaking of the Truth, ought not, nor may not, privily be amended
duly. Wherefore, Sirs, I pray you that ye busy you not for to move me
to follow these men in revoking and forsaking of the Truth and
Soothfastness! as they have done, and yet do; wherein by open
evidence, they stir GOD to great wroth, and not only against
themselves, but also against all them that favour them or consent to
them herein, or that comoneth [<i>communeth</i>] with them, except it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
for their amendment. For whereas these men first were pursued of
enemies, now they have obliged them by oath for to slander and pursue
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> in his members! Wherefore, as I trust stedfastly in the
goodness of GOD, the worldly covetousness, and the lusty living, and
the sliding from the truth of these runagates [<i>renegades</i>] shall be
to me, and to many other men and women, an example and an evidence to
stand the more stiffly by the Truth of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>

<p>"For, certain, right many men and women do mark and abhor the foulness
and cowardice of these aforesaid untrue men, how that they are
overcome, and stopped with benefices, and withdrawn from the truth of
GOD's Word, forsaking utterly to suffer therefore bodily persecution.
For by this unfaithful doing and apostasy, of them specially that are
great lettered men, and have [ac]knowledged openly the truth; and now
either for pleasure or displeasure of tyrants have taken hire and
temporal wages, to forsake the Truth and to hold against it,
slandering and pursuing them that covet to follow <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in the way of
righteousness: many men and women therefore are now moved. But many
more, through the grace of GOD, shall be moved hereby, for to learn
the Truth of GOD, and to do thereafter, and to stand boldly thereby."</p>

so together, that they will not swear to be obedient, and to submit

<p>"And, losell! I shall assay if can make thee there, as sorrowful as,

<p><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, there can nobody prove lawfully that I
joyed ever of the manner of your going out of this land [<i>the

joyful when ye were gone! for [<span class="smcap">Robert de Braybrooke</span>] the Bishop of

me longer in his prison; but, at the request of my friends, he
delivered me to them, asking of me no manner of submitting."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then the Archbishop said to me, "Wherefore that I yede

be glad to change thy voice!"</p>

<p>These and many more wondrous and convicious [<i>railing</i>] words were
spoken to me; menacing me and all others of the same sect, for to be
punished and destroyed to the uttermost.</p>

<p>And the Archbishop called then to him, a Clerk; and rounded with him
[<i>whispered in his ear</i>], and that Clerk went forth: and soon he
brought in the Constable of Saltwood Castle, and the Archbishop
rounded a good while with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Constable places him in a den.</span></div>

<p>And then the Constable went forth, and then came in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> divers secular
[<i>laymen</i>]; and they scorned me on every side, and menaced me greatly.
And some counselled the Archbishop to burn me by and by [<i>at once</i>]:
and some others counselled him to drown me in the sea, for it is near
[at] hand there.</p>

<p><b>A Clerk.</b> And a Clerk standing besides me there, kneeled down to the
Archbishop, praying him that he would deliver me to him for to say
<i>Matins</i> with him; and he would undertake that, within three days, I
should not resist anything that was commanded me to do, of my Prelate.</p>

<p>And the Archbishop said that he would ordain for me himself.</p>

<p>And then, after, came in again the Constable and spake privily to the
Archbishop.</p>

<p>And then the Archbishop commanded the Constable to lead me forth
thence, with him: and so he did.</p>

<p>And when we were gone forth thence, we were sent after again.</p>

<p>And when I came in again before the Archbishop, a Clerk bade me kneel
down, and ask grace, and submit me lowly, and I should find it for the
best.</p>

<p><b>William.</b> And I said then to the Archbishop, "Sir, as I have said to
you, divers times, to-day, I will wilfully and lowly obey and submit
me to be ordained ever, after my cunning and power, to GOD and His
Law, and to every member of Holy Church; as far forth as I can
perceive that these members accord with their head, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and will
teach me, rule me, or chastise me by authority specially of GOD's
Law."</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> And the Archbishop said, "I wist well, he would not,
without such additions, submit him!"</p>

<p>And then, I was rebuked, scorned, and menaced on every side; and yet,
after this, divers persons cried upon me to kneel down and submit me:
but I stood still, and spake no word.</p>

<p>And then there was spoken of me and to me many great words; and I
stood, and heard them menace, curse, and scorn me: but I said nothing.</p>

<p><b>Archbishop.</b> Then a while after, the Archbishop said to me, "Wilt thou
not submit thee to the ordinance of Holy Church?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span><b>William.</b> And I said, "Sir, I will full gladly submit me, as I have
shewed you before."</p>

<p>And then, the Archbishop bade the Constable to have me forth thence in
haste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">He thanks GOD, he is, at last, alone.</span></div>

<p>And so then I was led forth, and brought into a foul unhonest prison,
where I came never before. But, thanked be GOD! when all men were gone
forth then from me, and had sparred [<i>barred</i>] fast the prison door
after them, by and by [<i>immediately</i>] after, I therein by myself
busied me to think on GOD, and to thank Him of His goodness.</p>

<p>And I was then greatly comforted in all my wits, not only for that I
was then delivered, for a time, from the sight, from the hearing, from
the presence, from the scorning, and from the menacing of my enemies:
but much more I rejoiced in the LORD, because that through His grace,
He kept me so, both among the flattering specially, and among the
menacing of mine adversaries, that without heaviness and anguish of my
conscience, I passed away from them. For as a tree laid upon another
tree overthwart or on cross wise, so was the Archbishop and his three
Clerks always contrary to me, and I to them.</p>

<p>Now, good GOD! (for Thine holy name and for the praising of Thy most
blessed name, make us one together), if it be Thy will, by authority
of thy Word that is true perfect charity: and else not! And that it
may thus be, all that this writing read or hear, pray heartily to the
LORD GOD! that He (for His great goodness that cannot be with tongue
expressed) grant to us and to all others, that in the same</p>
<p class="center">wise and for the same cause specially, or for any other<br />
cause be at [a] distance, to be knit and made<br />
One in true Faith, in stedfast Hope, and<br />
in perfect Charity.<br />
Amen.</p>

<h3>And hereafter followeth his Testament.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">19 Sept. 1460.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William of Thorpe's <i>Testament</i>.</span></div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/mflower.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" alt="M" /></span><i><span class="smcap">atthew</span>, an Apostle of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his gospeller, witnesseth truly in
the Holy Gospel, the most holy living and the most wholesome teaching
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. He rehearseth how that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> likeneth them that hear his
words and keep them, to</i> a wise man that buildeth his house upon a
stone, <i>that is a stable and a sad</i> [firm] <i>ground</i>.</p>

<p><i>This</i> house <i>is man's soul, in whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> delighteth to dwell, if it
be grounded, that is, stablished, faithfully in his living, and in his
true teaching, adorned or made fair with divers virtues, which <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
used and taught without any meddling of any error, as are chiefly the
conditions of charity.</i></p>

<p><i>This foresaid</i> stone <i>is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, upon which every faithful soul must
be builded, since upon none other ground than upon <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s living and
his teaching, nobody may make any building or houseing wherein <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
will come and dwell. This sentence witnesseth <span class="smcap">Paul</span></i> to the
Corinthians, <i>shewing them that nobody may set any other ground than
is set, that is, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s living and his teaching.</i></p>

<p><i>And because that all men and women should give all their business
here in this life to build them virtuously upon this sure foundation,
Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span></i> [ac]<i>knowledging the fervent desire and the good will of the
people of Ephesus, wrote to them comfortably, saying</i>, Now ye are not
strangers, guests, nor yet comelings, but ye are the citizens and of
the household of GOD, builded above upon the foundament of the
Apostles and Prophets. In which foundament, every building that is
builded and made through the grace of GOD, it increaseth or groweth
into a holy temple; <i>that is, everybody that is</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> <i>grounded and builded
faithfully in the teaching and living of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is therethrough made
the holy temple of GOD.</i></p>

<p><i>This is the stable ground and stedfast</i> stone, <i><span class="smcap">Christ</span>! which is the
sure corner-stone fast joining and holding mightily together two
walls. For through <span class="smcap">Christ Jesu</span>, mean or middle Person of the Trinity,
the Father of Heaven is piteous or mercifully joined and made one
together to Mankind: and through dread to offend GOD, and fervent love
to please him, men be unseparably made one to GOD, and defended surely
under His protection.</i></p>

<p><i>Also this foresaid</i> stone <i><span class="smcap">Christ</span> was figured by the square stones of
which the Temple of GOD was made. For as a square stone, wheresoever
it is cast or laid, it abideth and lieth stably; so <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and every
faithful member of his Church, by example of him, abideth and dwelleth
stably in true faith and in all other heavenly virtues, in all
adversities that they suffer in this Valley of Tears. For, lo, when
these foresaid square stones were hewen and wrought for to be laid in
the walls or pillars of GOD's Temple, none noise or stroke of the
workmen was heard. Certain, this silence in working of this stone
figureth <span class="smcap">Christ</span> chiefly, and his faithful members, which by example of
him have been, and yet are, and ever to the world's end shall be, so
meek and patient in every adversity, that no sound nor yet any
grudging shall any time be perceived in them.</i></p>

<p><i>Nevertheless this chief and most worshipful corner-stone, which only
is ground of all virtues, proud beggars reproved! but this despite and
reproof <span class="smcap">Christ</span> suffered most meekly in his own person, for to give
example of all meekness and patience to all his faithful followers.
Certain, this world is now so full of proud beggars which are named
priests; but the very office of working of priesthood which <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
approveth true, and accepteth, is far from the multitude of priests
that now reign in this world.</i></p>

<p><i>For, from the highest priest to the lowest, all (as who say) study,
that is, they imagine and travail busily how they may please this
world and their flesh. This sentence and many such others dependeth
upon them, if it be well considered; either GOD the Father of heaven
hath deceived all mankind by the living specially</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> <i>and teaching of
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and by the living and teaching of his Apostles and
Prophets; all else all the Popes that have been since I had any
knowledge or discretion, with all the College of Cardinals,
Archbishops, and Bishops, Monks, Canons, and Friars, with all the
contagious flock of the comminalty of priesthood, which have, all my
life-time and mickle longer, reigned and yet reign and increase
damnably from sin into sin, have been and yet be proud obstinate
heretics, covetous simoners</i> [trafficers in ecclesiastical
preferments], <i>and defouled adulterers in the ministering of the
Sacraments, and especially in the ministering of the Sacrament of the
Altar.</i></p>

<p><i>For, as their works shew (whereto <span class="smcap">Christ</span> biddeth us take heed!) the
highest priests and Prelates of this priesthood challenge and occupy</i>
[hold] <i>unlawfully temporal lordships. And for temporal favour and
mede, they sell and give benefices to unworthy and unable persons;
yea, these simoners sell sin! suffering men and women in every degree
and estate, to lie and continue, from year to year, in divers vices
slanderously. And thus, by evil example of high priests in the Church,
lower priests under them are not only suffered, but they are
maintained to sell full dear to the people for temporal mede, all the
Sacraments. And thus all this foresaid priesthood is blown so high,
and borne up in pride and vainglory of their estate and dignity, and
so blinded with worldly covetousness, that they disdain to follow
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> in very meekness and wilful poverty, living holily, and
preaching GOD's Word truly, freely, and continually; taking their
livelihood at the free will of the people, of their pure almose</i>
[alms], <i>where and when, they suffice not (for their true and busy
preaching) to get their sustenance with their hands.</i></p>

<p><i>To this true sentence, grounded on <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s own living and teaching
of his Apostles; these foresaid worldly and fleshly priests will not
consent effectually. But, as their works and also their words shew,
boldly and unshamefastly these foresaid named priests and Prelates
covet, and enforce them mightily and busily, that all Holy Scripture
were expounded and drawn according to</i> their <i>manners, and to</i> their
<i>ungrounded</i> [unwarranted] <i>usages and findings.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> <i>For they will not
(since they hold it but folly and madness!) conform their manners to
the pure and simple living of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles, nor they will
not follow freely their learning. Wherefore all the Emperors and
Kings, and all other lords and ladies, and all the common people in
every degree and state, which have before time known or might have
known; and also all they that now yet know or might know this foresaid
witness of priesthood; and would not, nor yet will enforce them, after
their cunning and power, to withstand charitably the foresaid enemies
and traitors of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Church; all these strive, with
<span class="smcap">Antichrist</span>, against <span class="smcap">Jesu</span>! And they shall bear the indignation of GOD
Almighty without end, if in convenient time they amend them not, and
repent them verily; doing therefore due mourning and sorrow, after
their cunning and power.</i></p>

<p><i>For through presumptions and negligence of priests and Prelates (not
of the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, but occupying their prelacy, unduly in the
Church, and also by flattering and false covetousness of other divers
named priests), lousengers, and lounderers are wrongfully made and
called Hermits; and have leave to defraud poor and needy creatures of
their livelihood, and to live by their false winning and begging in
sloth and other divers vices. And also of these Prelates, these cokir
noses</i> [?] <i>are suffered to live in pride and hypocrisy, and to defoul
themselves both bodily and ghostly.</i></p>

<p><i>Also by the suffering and counsel of these foresaid Prelates and of
other priests, are made vain, both Brotherhoods and Sisterhoods, full
of pride and envy; which are full contrary to the Brotherhood of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, since they are cause of mickle dissension: and they multiply
and sustained it uncharitably, for in lusty eating, and drinking
unmeasurably and out of time, they exercise themselves. Also this vain
confederacy of Brotherhoods is permitted to be of one clothing, and to
hold together. And in all these ungrounded and unlawful doings,
priests are partners and great meddlers and counsellors.</i></p>

<p><i>And over this viciousness, hermits and pardoners, ankers</i>
[anchorites], <i>and strange beggars are licensed and admitted of</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<i>Prelates and priests for to beguile the people with flatterings and
leasings</i> [falsehoods] <i>slanderously, against all good reason and true
belief; and so to increase divers vices in themselves, and also among
all them that accept them or consent to them.</i></p>

<p><i>And thus, the viciousness of these forenamed priests and Prelates,
has been long time, and yet is, and shall be cause of wars, both
within the realm and without.</i></p>

<p><i>And, in the same wise, these unable</i> [useless] <i>priests have been,
and yet are, and shall be, the chief cause of pestilence of men, and
murrain of beasts, and of bareness of the earth, and of all other
mischiefs, to the time that Lords and Commons able them through grace
for to know and to keep the Commandments of GOD, enforcing them then
faithfully and charitably by one assent, for to redress and make one,
this foresaid priesthood to the wilful poor, meek, and innocent living
and teaching, specially of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his Apostles.</i></p>

<p><i>Therefore all they that know, or might know the viciousness that
reigneth now cursedly in these priests and in their learning, if they
suffice not to withstand this contagious viciousness: let them pray to
the LORD heartily for the health of his Church! abstaining them
prudently from these endured</i> [hardened] <i>enemies of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his
people, and from all their Sacraments! since to them all that know
them, or may know, they are but fleshly deeds and false: as Saint
<span class="smcap">Cyprian</span> witnesseth in the first Question of</i> Decrees <i>and in the
first</i> Cause. Ca. Si quis inquit.</p>

<p><i>For as this Saint, and great Doctors witness there, that not only
vicious priests, but also all they that favour them or consent to them
in their viciousness, shall together perish with them, if they amend
them not duly: as all they perished that consented to <span class="smcap">Dathan</span> and
<span class="smcap">Abiram</span>. For nothing were more confusion to these foresaid vicious
priests, than to eschew them prudently in all their unlawful
Sacraments, while they continue in their sinful living slanderously,
as they have long time done and yet do. And nobody need to be afraid,
though death did follow by any wise or other, for to die out of this
world without taking of any Sacrament of these foresaid <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s
enemies: since <span class="smcap">Christ</span> will not fail for to minister</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> <i>himself all
lawful and heal-ful sacraments, and necessary at all time; and
especially at the end, to all them that are in true faith, in
steadfast hope, and in perfect charity.</i></p>

<p><i>But yet some mad fools say, for to eschew slander they will be
shriven once a year and comuned</i> [receive the Sacrament] <i>of their
proper priests; though they know them defouled with slanderous vices.
No doubt, but all they that thus do or consent, privily or apertly, to
such doing, are culpable of great sin; since St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span> witnesseth that
not only they that do evil are worthy of death and damnation, but also
they that consent to evil doers. Also, as their slanderous works
witness, these foresaid vicious priests despise and cast from them
heavenly cunning that is given of the HOLY GHOST. Wherefore the LORD
throweth all such despisers from Him, that they use nor do any
priesthood to Him. No doubt then, all they that wittingly or wilfully
take, or consent that any other body should take any Sacrament of any
such named priest, sinneth openly and damnably against all the
Trinity, and are unable to any Sacrament of health.</i></p>

<p><i>And that this foresaid sentence</i> [opinion] <i>is altogether true unto
remission of all my sinful living, trusting steadfastly in the mercy
of GOD, I offer to Him my soul!</i></p>

<p><i>And to prove also this foresaid sentence true, with the help of GOD,
I purpose fully to suffer meekly and gladly my most wretched body to
be tormented, where GOD will! and of whom He will! how He will and
when He will! and as long as He will! and what temporal pain He will!
and death! to the praising of His name, and to the edification of His
Church. And I, that am most unworthy and wretched caitiff, shall now,
through the special grace of GOD, make to Him pleasant sacrifice of my
most sinful and unworthy body.</i></p>

Estate of the which, GOD gave charge that one should help another, and
none destroy other.</i></p>

<p><i>As to Priests, they should be most holy and least worldly; and truly
living as near as they could, after the example of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and his
Apostles. And all their business should be, day and night, in holy
example of living, and true preaching and teaching of GOD's Law to
both the other parts. And also they should be most meek, most
serviceable, and most lovely in spirit, both to GOD and man.</i></p>

<p><i>In the second part of this Church, that is Knighthood, be contained
all that bear the sword by the law of Office: which should maintain
GOD's Law to be preached and taught to the people; and principally the
Gospel of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and truly to live thereafter. The which part should
rather put themselves to peril of death, than to suffer any Law or
Constitution</i> [referring to the Constitutions of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span> in 1408] <i>to
be made of man, wherethrough the freedom of GOD's Law might be letted
to be preached and taught to the people, or whereof any error or
heresy might grow in the Church. For I suppose fully that there may
come none heresy nor error among the people, but by false Laws,
Constitutions, or teachings contrary to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s Law, or by false
leasings</i> [lies].</p>

<p><i>Also the second part should defend the common people from tyrants,
oppressors, and extortioners: and maintain the Clergy, doing truly
their office, in preaching, teaching, praying, and freely ministering
the Sacraments of Holy Church. And if this Clergy be negligent in
doing this office, this second part of the Church ought, by their
office that they have taken of GOD, to constrain the Clergy in due
wise, to do their office in the form that GOD hath ordained to be
done.</i></p>

<p><i>The third part of this Fighting Church oweth</i> [ought] <i>to bear good
will to Lords and Priests, truly to do their bodily labour in tilling
the earth, and with their true merchandise doing their duties that
they owe both to Knighthood and to Priesthood, as GOD's Law limiteth;
keeping faithfully the commandments of GOD.</i></p>

<p><i>Moreover, I believe all the Sacraments of Holy Church for to be</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<i>meedful and profitable to all that shall be saved; taking them after
the intent that GOD and Holy Church have ordained.</i></p>

<p><i>And for as mickle as I am slandered falsely in my Belief in the
Sacrament of the Altar, I do all Christian men to wit, that I believe
verily that the most blessed Sacrament of the Altar is very <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s
body in form of bread; the same body that was born of the blessed
Virgin our Lady Saint <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, done on the cross, dead, buried, and on
the third day rose from death to life, the which body is now glorified
in heaven.</i></p>

<p><i>Also I believe that all GOD's Law is true; and who that liveth
contrary to this blessed Law, and so continueth to his life's end, and
dieth so breaking the holy commandments of GOD, that he shall be
damned into everlasting pains. And he that will learn this most
blessed Law, and live thereafter, keeping these holy commandments of
GOD, and endeth in charity shall have everlasting bliss.</i></p>

<p><i>Also I understand that this followeth of Belief, that our Lord <span class="smcap">Jesu
Christ</span> (that is both GOD and Man) asketh no more here in earth, but
that he obey to him after the form of his Law, in truly keeping of it.
And if any Prelate of the Church ask more obedience than this, of any
man living; he exalteth himself, in that, above <span class="smcap">Christ</span>: and so he is
an open Antichrist.</i></p>

<p><i>Also these points I hold as of Belief in especial.</i></p>

<p><i>And in general, I believe all that GOD wills that I believe, praying,
at the reverence of Almighty GOD, to you my liege Lord</i> [<span class="smcap">Henry</span> V.]
<i>that this Belief might be examined by the wisest and truest Clerks of
your realm: and if it be truth, that it might be confirmed, and I to
be holden for a true Christian man; and if it be false, that it might
be damned</i> [condemned], <i>and I taught a better Belief by GOD's Law;
and I will gladly obey thereto</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This foresaid Belief, the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> wrote; and took it with him, and
offered it to the King [<i><span class="smcap">Henry</span> V.</i>], for to see: and the King would
not receive it, but bade him take it to them that should be his
judges.</p>

<p>And then the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> offered to bring before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> King, to
purge him of all error and heresy, that they would put against him, a
hundred Knights and Squires.</p>

<p>And also he offered to fight with any man, Christian or heathen, that
would say he were false in his belief; except the King and his
brethren.</p>

<p>And after, he said "He would submit him to all manner [of] correction,
that any man would correct him, after GOD's Law."</p>

<p>And notwithstanding all this, the King suffered him to be summoned
personally, in his own [<i>the King's</i>] chamber.</p>

<p>And the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said to the King, that he had appealed to the
Pope from the Archbishop; and therefore, he said, "he ought not to
take him for his judge": and so he had there his Appeal ready written,
and shewed to the King.</p>

<p>And therewith the King was more angry, and said, "He should not pursue
his appeal: but rather he should be in ward till his appeal were
admitted, and then (would he or not!) he should be his judge!"</p>

<p>And thus nothing of all this was allowed; but, because he would not
swear to submit him to the Church, and take what penance the
Archbishop would enjoin him, he was arrested, and sent to the Tower of
London to keep his day that the [arch]bishop assigned him in the
King's Chamber.</p>

<p>And then he made the <i>Belief</i> aforesaid, with the <i>Answer</i> to <i>Four
Points</i> that now follow, to be written in two parts of an Indenture.</p>

<p>And when he came to answer; he gave that one part to the [arch]bishop,
and that other part he kept to himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">His <i>Answer</i> to the <i>Four Points</i></span>.</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/ibaby.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-right: 0.25em;" alt="I" /></span><i>, <span class="smcap">John Oldcastle</span> Knight, and Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, will that all Christian
men wit, how that <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> of <span class="smcap">Arundell</span>, Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> hath
not only laid it to my charge maliciously, but also very untruly, by
his Letter and his Seal written against me in most slanderous wise,
that I should otherwise feel and teach of the Sacraments of the Holy
Church; assigning in special the Sacrament of the Altar, the Sacrament
of Penance, and also in Worshipping of Images, and in Going on
Pilgrimages, otherwise</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> <i>than feeleth and teacheth the universal Holy
Church. I take Almighty GOD to witness, that it hath been, and now is,
and ever, with the help of GOD, shall be, mine intent and my will to
believe faithfully and truly in all the Sacraments that ever GOD
ordained to be done in Holy Church.</i></p>

<p><i>And, moreover, for to declare me in these points aforesaid.</i></p>

<p><i>I believe that the most worshipful Sacrament of the Altar is very
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body in form of bread: the same body that was born of the
blessed Virgin our Lady Saint <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, done on the cross, dead and
buried, and the third day rose from death to life; the which body is
now glorified in heaven.</i></p>

<p><i>Also as for the Sacrament of Penance, I believe that it is needful to
every man that shall be saved, to forsake sin, and to do due penance
for sin before done, with true confession, very contrition, and, due
satisfaction, as GOD's Law limiteth and teacheth; and else, may he not
be saved; which penance I desire all men to do.</i></p>

<p><i>And as for Images, I understand that they be not of Belief, but they
were ordained (since Belief was given of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>) by sufferance of the
Church for to be Kalenders to laymen, to represent and bring to mind
the Passion of our Lord <span class="smcap">Jesu Christ</span>, and</i> [the] <i>martyrdom and good
living of other Saints. And that who so it be, that doeth the worship
to dead images that is due to GOD; or putteth hope, faith, or trust in
help of them as he should do to GOD; or hath affection in one more
than in another: he doth in that, the great sin of Idolatry.</i></p>

<p><i>Also I suppose this fully, that every man in this earth is a Pilgrim
towards Bliss or towards Pains. And he that knoweth not, nor will not
know, nor keep the holy commandments of GOD in his living (albeit that
he goeth on pilgrimage in all parts of the world), and he die so, he
shall be damned. And he that knoweth the holy commandments of GOD and
keepeth them to his end, he shall be saved; though he never in his
life, go on pilgrimage as men use</i> [are accustomed] <i>now to
Canterbury, or to Rome, or to any other place.</i></p>

foresaid <i>Answers</i>, he took to the Bishops when he came to answer [<i>in
the Chapter House of St. Paul's</i>] on the Saturday next before
Michaelmas in the year beforesaid [<i>September 23, 1413</i>].</p>

<p>And whatsoever the Bishops asked him, he bade them look what his Bill

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Thomas Arundell</span>] the Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, [<span class="smcap">Richard Clifford</span>] the
Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>, [<span class="smcap">Henry Beaufort</span>] the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, [<span class="smcap">Benedict

Orders of Friars, and many other Clerks, deeming and convicting him
for an heretic and a cursed man.</p>

<p>The Archbishop made all these Clerks, both Religious and Secular, to
swear upon a book, that they should not, for love or favour of the one
party, nor for any envy or hatred of the other party, say, nor witness
but the truth.</p>

<p>And the two foresaid Notaries were sworn also to write and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> to witness
the words and process that were to be said on both the parties, and to
say the sooth if it otherwise were.</p>

<p>After this, the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> came, and was brought before them all,
to his Examination, and to his Answer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Abp. again offers to absolve him</span>.</div>

<p>Then the Archbishop said to him, "Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, ye be advised well
enough of the words and Process that were said to you, upon Saturday
last past, in the Chapter House of Paul's: the which Process were now
too long to rehearse. Then I proffered to have assoiled [<i>absolve</i>]
you (for ye were accursed!) of your contumacy and disobedience to Holy
Church."</p>

<p>Then said the Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> forthwith, "GOD saith, <i>Maledicam
benedictionibus vestris</i>, that is to say, 'I shall curse your
blessings!'"</p>

<p>Then said the Archbishop, "Sir, then I proffered to have assoiled you,
if ye would have asked it; and yet I do the same!"</p>

<p>Then said the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, "Nay, forsooth, I trespassed never
against you! and therefore will I not do it."</p>

<p>And with that, he kneeled down on the pavement, and held up his hands
and said, "I shrive me to GOD! and to you all, Sirs! that, in my
youth, I have sinned greatly and grievously in lechery and in pride,
and hurt many men, and done many other horrible sins; Good Lord! I cry
Thee, mercy!"</p>

<p>And therewith weepingly, he stood up again and said, "Here, for the
breaking of GOD's Law and His commandments, ye cursed me not! but for
your own laws and traditions, above GOD's Law: and therefore it shall
be destroyed."</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop examined the Lord of his <i>Belief</i>. And the Lord of
<span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "I believe fully in all GOD's Law, and I believe that it
is all true! and I believe all that GOD wills that I believe."</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop examined him of the Sacrament of the Altar, how he
believed therein?</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "<span class="smcap">Christ</span> upon Shere [<i>or Shrive or Maunday</i>]
Thursday [<i>the day before Good Friday</i>] at night, sitting with his
disciples at the Supper, after that he had supped, he took bread and
giving thanks to the Father, he blessed it and brake it, and gave it
to his disciples saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> <i>Take, and eat ye of this, all! This is my
body that shall be betrayed for you! Do you this, in the remembrance
of me.</i> This I believe!" said he.</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop asked him, "If it were bread after the
consecration, and the sacramental words said?"</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "I believe that the Sacrament of the Altar is
very <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body in form of bread; the same body that was born of
the Virgin <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, done on the cross, dead and buried, and the third day
rose from death to life: which body is now glorified in heaven."</p>

<p>Then said one of the Doctors of the Law, "After the sacramental words
said, there remaineth no bread but the body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!"</p>

<p>Then the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said to one, Master <span class="smcap">John Whitehead</span>, "You said
to me in the Castle of Cowling [<i>Lord <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>'s home</i>], that the host
sacred was not <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body: but I said, 'It was <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body!'
though Seculars and Friars hold each one against other in this
opinion."</p>

<p>Then said they, "We say all that it is GOD's body!"</p>

<p>And they asked him, "Whether it were material bread after the
consecration?"</p>

<p>Then said the Lord, "I believe it is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body in form of bread.
Sir, believe ye not thus?"</p>

<p>And the Archbishop said, "Yea!"</p>

<p>Then the Doctors asked him, "Whether it were only <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body after
the consecration, and no bread?"</p>

<p>And he said to them, "It is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body and bread. For right as
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> was here in manhood, and the godhead hid in the manhood: so I
believe verily that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s flesh and his blood is hid there in the
form of bread."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Smiling they say, "It is an heresy</span>!"</div>

<p>Then they smiled each on other, deeming him taken in heresy; and said,
"It is an heresy!"</p>

<p>The Archbishop asked him, "What bread it was?" and the Clerks also,
"Whether it were material or not?"</p>

<p>Then the Lord said, "The Gospel speaketh not of this term <i>material</i>;
and therefore I will not! but say, it is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body and bread! For
the Gospel saith, <i>Ego sum panis vivus qui de c&oelig;lo descendi</i>, that
is to say, "I am quick bread that came down from heaven." For as our
Lord <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> is Very GOD and Very Man; so the most blessed
Sacrament of the Altar is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body and bread.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>"</p>

<p>Then they said, "It is an heresy, to say that it is bread after the
consecration and the sacramental words said, but only <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body."</p>

<p>The Lord said, "Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span> the Apostle was as wise as ye be! and he
called it <i>bread</i>; where he saith thus <i>The bread that we break, is it
not the partaking of the body of the LORD?</i>"</p>

<p>Then they said, "<span class="smcap">Paul</span> must be otherwise understanded; for it is an
heresy to say, that it is bread after the consecration, but only
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body: for it is against the determination of the Church."</p>

<p>Then they asked him, "Whether he believed not in the determination of
the Church?"</p>

<p>And he said, "No, forsooth! but I believe all GOD's Law, and all that
GOD wills that I believe; but not in your law nor in your
determination: for ye be no part of Holy Church, as openly your deeds
shew; but very Antichrists, contrary to GOD's law. For ye have made
laws for your covetousness."</p>

<p>"This," they said, "was heresy: not for to believe in the
determination of the Church."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Lollard definition of "Holy Church</span>."</div>

<p>Then the Archbishop asked him, "What was Holy Church?"</p>

<p>He said, "I believe that Holy Church is the number of all them that
shall be saved; of whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is head: of the which Church, one part
is in Heaven, another in Purgatory, and the third here in Earth. This
part here, standeth in three degrees and estates, Priesthood,
Knighthood, and the Comminalty, as I said plainly in my <i>Belief</i>."</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop said to him, "Wot you who is of this Church? It is
doubt to you who is thereof? Ye should not judge!"</p>

<p>The Lord said, "<i>Operibus credite! justum judicium judicate!</i>" that is
to say, "Believe ye the works! judge ye rightful judgement!"</p>

<p>Also he said to them all, "Where find ye by GOD's Law, that ye should
set thus upon any man, or any man's death, as ye do? But <span class="smcap">Annas</span> and
<span class="smcap">Caiaphas</span> sat and judged <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and so do you!"</p>

<p>Then said they, "Yes, Sir, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> judged <span class="smcap">Judas</span>!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The venom of worldly possessions</span>.</div>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "No, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> judged not <span class="smcap">Judas</span>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> but he judged
himself, and went and hanged himself: but <span class="smcap">Christ</span> said, <i>Woe to him</i>,
as he doth to many of you! For since the venom was shed into the
Church; ye followed never Christ, nor ye stood never in perfection of
GOD's Law!"</p>

<p>Then the Archbishop asked him, "What was that venom?"</p>

<p>The Lord said, "The lordships and possessions. For then, cried an
angel, 'Woe! woe! woe! This day is venom shed into the Church of GOD!'
For before that time, there many martyrs of Popes; and since I can
tell of none! but, sooth it is, since that time one hath put down
another, and one hath slain another, and one hath cursed another, as
the Chronicles tell; also of much more cursedness."</p>

<p>Also he said, "<span class="smcap">Christ</span> was meek, and the Pope is proud. <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was poor
and forgave; the Pope is rich and a man-slayer, as it is openly
proved. And thus this is the nest of Antichrist, and out of this nest
cometh Antichrist's disciples, of whom these Monks and Friars be the
tail."</p>

<p>Then said [<span class="smcap">Richard Dodington</span>] Prior of the Friars Augustines, "Sir,
why say ye so?"</p>

<p>And the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "For as ye be Pharisees, "divided," and
divided in habit [<i>dress</i>]; so ye make division among the people. And
thus these friars and monks with such others be the members of the
nest of Antichrist."</p>

<p>And he said, "<span class="smcap">Christ</span> saith, <i>Woe be to you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye close up the Kingdom of Heaven before men: for,
sooth, ye enter not yourselves! nor ye will not suffer them that
would, to enter in!</i> And thus, ye be the disciples of Antichrist! For
ye will not suffer GOD's Law to go through, nor to be taught and
preached of good priests; which will speak against your sins, and
reprove them: but of such that be flatterers, which sustain you in
your sins and cursedness."</p>

<p>Then said the Archbishop, "By our Lady! Sir, there shall no such
preach, that preacheth dissension and division, if GOD will!"</p>

<p>Then said the Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> to the Archbishop, "<span class="smcap">Christ</span> saith that
<i>there shall be so great tribulation, as never was since the
beginning.</i> And this shall be in your days! and by you! for ye have
slain many men, and shall more hereafter: but <span class="smcap">Christ</span> saith, <i>Except
that those days were shortened, no flesh</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> <i>should be saved</i>: but
hastily GOD will short[en] your days! Furthermore, Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons be grounded in GOD's Law: but not these other Religious
[<i>Monks and Friars</i>] as far as I can wit."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The 4 Determinations of the Church</span>.</div>

<p>Then a Doctor of Law, one Master <span class="smcap">John Kemp</span>, put to him these four
Points that follow:</p>

<p>"<i>The faith and determination of Holy Church touching the blessed
Sacrament of the Altar is this. That after the sacramental words be
said of a priest in his</i> Mass, <i>the material bread that was before, is
turned into <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body, and the material wine that was before, is
turned into <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s very blood: and so there remaineth in the
Sacrament of the Altar, no material bread nor material wine; the which
were there, before the saying of the sacramental words.</i> Sir, believe
you this?"</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "This is not my belief. For my belief is, as
I said to you before, that the worshipful Sacrament of the Altar is
very <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s body in form of bread."</p>

<p>Then said the Archbishop, "Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>! ye must say otherwise!"</p>

<p>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span> said, "Nay, if GOD will! but that it is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>'s
body in form of bread, as all the common belief is."</p>

<p>The Doctor [<span class="smcap">John Kemp</span>] said, "The second is this, <i>The Holy Church
hath determined that every Christian man living bodily upon the earth
oweth</i> [ought] <i>to be shriven to a priest ordained by the Church, if
he may come to him.</i> Sir, what say ye to this?"</p>

<p>The Lord answered and said, "A sick man and sore wounded had need to
have a sure Leech and a true, knowing his cure; and therefore a man
should be principally shriven to GOD; and else his confession is
nought. And a man should rather go and be counselled with a good

own priest, if he were an evil man, or with any other such."</p>

<p>The Doctor said, "The Third is this, <i><span class="smcap">Christ</span> ordained Saint <span class="smcap">Peter</span> to
be his Vicar in earth, whose See is the Church of Rome; ordaining and
granting that the same power that he gave</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> <i>to <span class="smcap">Peter</span> should succeed to
all <span class="smcap">Peter</span>'s successors, the which we call now the Popes of Rome: by
whose power in the Church particularly and specially, be ordained
Prelates as Archbishops, Bishops, and other degrees; to whom Christian
men owe</i> [ought] <i>to obey after the law of the Church of Rome.</i> This
is the determination of the Church."</p>

<p>To this, he answered and said, "Who that followeth next <span class="smcap">Peter</span> in
living, is next him in succession: but your living refuseth poor
<span class="smcap">Peter</span>'s living, and many other Popes that were martyrs in Rome that
followed <span class="smcap">Peter</span> in manner of living; whose conditions ye have clean
forsaken, all the world may know it well!"</p>

<p>The Doctor said, "The fourth point is this. <i>Holy Church hath
determined that it is meedful to a Christian man, to go on pilgrimages
to holy places; and there especially to worship holy relics of Saints,
Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and all Saints approved by the Church
of Rome.</i>"</p>

<p>To this, he said, "It were enough to bury Saints fair in the earth;
but now Saints that be dead, be compelled to beg for covetousness! the
which in their life, hated covetousness and begging. But I say to you
all, and know it for a truth, that with your shrines and idols, and
your feigned absolutions and indulgences, and your temporalities, ye
draw to you all the richesse of this world."</p>

<p>"Why Sir," said one of the Clerks, "will ye not worship images?"</p>

<p>"What worship?" said the Lord.</p>

<p>Then said Friar [<span class="smcap">Thomas</span>] <span class="smcap">Palmer</span> [Warden of the Minorites], "Sir, ye

<p>A Clerk said, "Such worship as <span class="smcap">Paul</span> speaketh of, that is this, <i>GOD

<p>Then said the Lord, and spread his arms abroad, "This is a very
cross!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>Then said the [<span class="smcap">Henry Beauclerc</span>] Bishop of <span class="smcap">London</span>, "Sir, ye wot well!
that he died on a material cross."</p>

<p>Then said the Lord, "Our salvation come in only by him that died on
the cross, and by the material cross. And, well I wot, that this was
the cross that <span class="smcap">Paul</span> joyed on, that is, in the Passion of our LORD <span class="smcap">Jesu

<p>The Archbishop said, "Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>! ye must submit you to the ordinance of

<div class="sidenote">How every man should con and keep the scripture, and holy
writ is the scripture of peoples, as Jerome saith.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/fscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="F" /></span>or as much as Christ saith that the gospel shall be preached in all
the world, and David saith of the apostles and their preaching, "the
sound of them yede out into each land, and the words of them yeden out
into the ends of the world," and eft David saith, "the Lord shall tell
in the scriptures of peoples, and of these princes that were in it,"
that is, in holy church, and as Jerome saith on that verse, "holy writ
is the scripture of peoples, for it is made, that all peoples should
know it," and the princes of the church, that were therein, be the
apostles, that had authority to write holy writ, for by that same that
the apostles wrote their scriptures by authority, and confirming of
the Holy Ghost, it is holy scripture, and faith of Christian men, and
this dignity hath no man after them, be he never so holy, never so
cunning, as Jerome witnesseth on that verse. Also, Christ saith of the
Jews that cried "Hosanna" to him in the temple, that though they were
still, stones should cry, and by stones he understandeth heathen men,
that worshipped stones for their gods. And we English men be come of
heathen men, therefore we be understood by these stones, that should
cry holy writ, and as Jews, that is interpreted knowledging, signify
clerks, that should knowledge to God, by repentance of sins, and by
voice of God's hearing, so our lewd men, suing the corner-stone
Christ, may be signified by stones, that be hard and abiding in the
foundation; for though covetous clerks be wood by simony, heresy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> and
many other sins, and despise and stop holy writ, as much as they may,
yet the lewd people crieth after holy writ, to con it, and keep it,
with great cost and peril of their life. For these reasons and other,
with common charity to save all men in our realm, which God would have
saved, a simple creature hath translated the bible out of Latin into
English. First, this simple creature had much travail, with divers
fellows and helpers, to gather many old bibles, and other doctors, and
common gloses, and to make one Latin bible some deal true; and then to
study it of the new, the text with the glose, and other doctors, as he
might get, and specially Lyra<small><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></small> on the Old Testament, that helped
full much in this work; the third time to counsel with old grammarians
and old divines, of hard words, and hard sentences, how they might
best be understood and translated; the fourth time to translate as
clearly as he could to the sentence, and to have many good fellows and
cunning at the correcting of the translation. First, it is to know,
that the best translating is out of Latin into English, to translate
after the sentence, and not only after the words, so that the sentence
be as open, either opener, in English as in Latin, and go not far from
the letter; and if the letter may not be sued in the translating, let
the sentence ever be whole and open, for the words owe to serve to the
intent and sentence, and else the words be superfluous either false.
In translating into English, many resolutions may make the sentence
open, as an ablative case absolute may be resolved into these three
words, with covenable verb, <i>the while</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>if</i>, as grammarians
say; as thus, <i>the master reading, I stand</i>, may be resolved thus,
<i>while the master readeth, I stand</i>, either <i>if the master readeth</i>,
etc., either <i>for the master</i>, etc.; and sometimes it will accord well
with the sentence to be resolved into <i>when</i>, either into <i>afterward</i>,
thus <i>when the master read, I stood</i>, either <i>after the master read, I
stood</i>; and sometime it may well be resolved into a verb of the same
tense, as other be in the same reason, and into this word <i>et</i>, that
is, <i>and</i> in English, as thus, <i>arescentibus hominibus prae timore</i>,
that is, <i>and men shall wax dry for dread</i>. Also a participle of a
present tense, either preterite, of active voice, either passive, may
be resolved into a verb of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> same tense, and a conjunction
copulative, as thus, <i>dicens</i>, that is, <i>saying</i>, may be resolved
thus, <i>and saith</i>, either <i>that saith</i>; and this will, in many places,
make the sentence open, where to English it after the word, would be
dark and doubtful. Also a relative, <i>which</i>, may be resolved into his
antecedent with a conjunction copulative, as thus, <i>which runneth, and
he runneth</i>. Also when a word is once set in a reason, it may be set
forth as oft as it is understood, either as oft as reason and need
ask; and this word <i>autem</i> either <i>vero</i>, may stand for <i>forsooth</i>,
either for <i>but</i>, and thus I use commonly; and sometimes it may stand
for <i>and</i>, as old grammarians say. Also when rightful construction is
letted by relation, I resolve it openly, thus, where this reason,
<i>Dominum formidabunt adversarii ejus</i>, should be Englished thus by the
letter, <i>the Lord his adversaries shall dread</i>, I English it thus by
resolution, <i>the adversaries of the Lord shall dread him</i>; and so of
other reasons that be like. At the beginning I purposed, with God's
help, to make the sentence as true and open in English as it is in
Latin, either more true and more open than it is in Latin; and I pray,
for charity and for common profit of Christian souls, that if any wise
man find any default of the truth of translation, let him set in the
true sentence and open of holy writ, but look that he examine truly
his Latin bible, for no doubt he shall find full many bibles in Latin
full false, if he look, many, namely new; and the common Latin bibles
have more need to be corrected, as many as I have seen in my life,
than hath the English bible late translated; and where the Hebrew, by
witness of Jerome, of Lyra, and other expositors discordeth from our
Latin bibles, I have set in the margin, by manner of a glose, what the
Hebrew hath, and how it is understood in some place; and I did this
most in the Psalter, that of all our books discordeth most from
Hebrew; for the church readeth not the Psalter by the last translation
of Jerome out of Hebrew into Latin, but another translation of other
men, that had much less cunning and holiness than Jerome had; and in
full few books the church readeth the translation of Jerome, as it may
be proved by the proper originals of Jerome, which he glosed. And
whether I have translated as openly or openlier in English as in
Latin, let wise men deem, that know well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> both languages, and know
well the sentence of holy scripture. And whether I have done thus, or
nay, ne doubt, they that con well the sentence of holy writ and
English together, and will travail, with God's grace, thereabout, may
make the bible as true and as open, yea, and openlier in English than
it is in Latin. And no doubt to a simple man, with God's grace and
great travail, men might expound much openlier and shortlier the bible
in English, than the old great doctors han expounded it in Latin, and
much sharplier and groundlier than many late postillators, either
expositors, han done. But God, of his great mercy, give to us grace to
live well, and to say the truth in covenable manner, and acceptable to
God and his people, and to spill not our time, be it short, be it
long, at God's ordinance. But some, that seem wise and holy, say thus,
if men now were as holy as Jerome was, they might translate out of
Latin into English, as he did out of Hebrew and out of Greek into
Latin, and else they should not translate now, as them thinketh, for
default of holiness and of cunning. Though this replication seem
colourable, it hath no good ground, neither reason, neither charity,
for why this <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'replicacion'">replication</ins> is more against saint Jerome, and against the
first seventy translators, and against holy church, than against
simple men, that translate now into English; for saint Jerome was not
so holy as the apostles and evangelists, whose books he translated
into Latin, neither had he so high gifts of the Holy Ghost as they
had; and much more the seventy translators were not so holy as Moses
and the prophets, and specially David, neither they had so great gifts
of God, as Moses and the prophets had. Furthermore holy church
approveth, not only the true translation of mean Christian men,
steadfast in Christian faith, but also of open heretics, that did away
many mysteries of Jesus Christ by guileful translation, as Jerome
witnesseth in a prologue on Job, and in the prologue of Daniel. Much
more let the Church of England approve the true and whole translation
of simple men, that would for no good in earth, by their witting and
power, put away the least truth, yea, the least letter, either tittle,
of holy writ, that beareth substance, either charge. And dispute they
not of the holiness of men now living in this deadly life, for they
con not thereon, and it is reserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> only to God's doom. If they know
any notable default by the translators, either helpers of them, let
them blame the default by charity and mercy, and let them never damn a
thing that may be done lawfully by God's law, as wearing of a good
cloth for a time, either riding on a horse for a great journey, when
they wit not wherefore it is done; for such things may be done of
simple men, with as great charity and virtue, as some, that hold them
great and wise, can ride in a gilt saddle, either use cushions and
beds and cloths of gold and of silk, with other vanities of the world.
God grant pity, mercy, and charity, and love of common profit, and put
away such foolish dooms, that be against reason and charity. Yet
worldly clerks ask greatly what spirit maketh idiots hardy to
translate now the bible into English, since the four great doctors
durst never do this? This replication, is so lewd, that it needeth no
answer, no but stillness, either courteous scorn; for the great
doctors were none English men, neither they were conversant among
English men, neither in case they could the language of English, but
they ceased never till they had holy writ in their mother tongue, of
their own people. For Jerome, that was a Latin man of birth,
translated the Bible, both out of Hebrew and out of Greek, into Latin,
and expounded full much thereto; and Austin, and many more Latins
expounded the bible, for many parts, in Latin, to Latin men, among
which they dwelt, and Latin was a common language to their people
about Rome, and beyond, and on this half, as English is common
language to our people, and yet this day the common people in Italy
speak Latin corrupt, as true men say, that han been in Italy; and the
number of translators out of Greek into Latin passeth man's knowing,
as Austin witnesseth in the 2nd book of Christian Teaching, and saith
thus, "the translators out of Hebrew into Greek may be numbered, but
Latin translators, either they that translated into Latin, may not be
numbered in any manner." For in the first times of faith, each man, as
a Greek book came to him, and he seemed to himself to have some
cunning of Greek and of Latin, was hardy to translate; and this thing
helped more than letted understanding, if readers be not negligent,
forwhy the beholding of many books hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> showed oft, either declared,
some darker sentences. This saith Austin there. Therefore Grosted
saith, that it was God's will, that divers men translated, and that
divers translations be in the church, for where one said darkly, one
either more said openly. Lord God! since at the beginning of faith so
many men translated into Latin, and to great profit of Latin men, let
one simple creature of God translate into English, for profit of
English men; for if worldly clerks look well their chronicles and
books, they should find, that Bede translated the bible, and expounded
much in Saxon, that was English, either common language of this land,
in his time; and not only Bede, but also King Alured, that founded
Oxford, translated in his last days the beginning of the Psalter into
Saxon, and would more, if he had lived longer. Also French men,
Beemers<small><a name="f27.1" id="f27.1" href="#f27">[27]</a></small> and Bretons have the bible, and other books of devotion
and of exposition, translated in their mother language; why should not
English men have the same in their mother language, I can not wit, no
but for falseness and negligence of clerks, either for our people is
not worthy to have so great grace and gift of God, in pain of their
old sins. God for his mercy amend these evil causes, and make our
people to have, and con, and keep truly holy writ, to life and death!</p>

<p>But in translating of words equivocal, that is, that hath many
significations under one letter, may lightly be peril, for Austin
saith in the 2nd book of Christian Teaching, that if equivocal words
be not translated into the sense, either understanding, of the author,
it is error; as in that place of the Psalm, <i>the feet of them be swift
to shed out blood</i>, the Greek word is equivocal to <i>sharp</i> and
<i>swift</i>, and he that translated <i>sharp feet</i>, erred, and a book that
hath <i>sharp feet</i>, is false, and must be amended; as that sentence
<i>unkind young trees shall not give deep roots</i>, oweth to be thus,
<i>plantings of aoutrry shall not give deep roots</i>. Austin saith this
there. Therefore a translator hath great need to study well the
sentence, both before and after, and look that such equivocal words
accord with the sentence, and he hath need to live a clean life, and
be full devout in prayers, and have not his wit occupied about worldly
things, that the Holy Spirit, author of wisdom, and cunning, and
truth, dress him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>in his work, and suffer him not for to err. Also
this word <i>ex</i> signifieth sometimes <i>of</i>, and sometimes it signifieth
<i>by</i>, as Jerome saith; and this word <i>enim</i> signifieth commonly
<i>forsooth</i>, and, as Jerome saith, it signifieth <i>cause thus, for why</i>;
and this word <i>secundum</i> is taken for <i>after</i>, as many men say, and
commonly, but it signifieth well <i>by</i>, either <i>up</i>, thus <i>by your
word</i>, either <i>up your word</i>. Many such adverbs, conjunctions, and
prepositions be set oft one for another, and at free choice of authors
sometimes; and now they shall be taken as it accordeth best to the
sentence. By this manner, with good living and great travail, men may
come to true and clear translating, and true understanding of holy
writ, seem it never so hard at the beginning. God grant to us all
grace to con well, and keep well holy writ, and suffer joyfully some
pain for it at the last! Amen.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/tscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="T" /></span><span class="smcap">he Lord.</span>&mdash;Sith the time that the great and high tower of Babylon was
builded, men have spoken with divers tongues, in such wise that divers
men be strange to other and understand not others' speech. Speech is
not known but if it be learned; common learning of speech is by
hearing, and so alway he that is deaf is alway dumb, for he may not
hear speech for to learn. So men of far countries and lands that have
divers speeches, if neither of them have learned others' language,
neither of them wot what other meaneth. Though they meet and have
great need of information and of lore of talking and of speech, be the
need never so great, neither of them understandeth other's speech no
more than gagling of geese. For jangle that one never so fast, that
other is never the wiser, though he shrew him instead of
'good-morrow'! This is a great mischief that followeth now mankind;
but God of His mercy and grace hath ordained double remedy. One is
that some man learneth and knoweth many divers speeches, and so
between strange men, of the which neither understandeth other's
speech, such a man may be mean and tell either what other will mean.
That other remedy is that one language is learned, used, and known in
many nations and lands. And so Latin is learned, known, and used,
specially on this half Greece, in all the nations and lands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Europe. Therefore clerks, of their goodness and courtesy, make and
write their books in Latin, for their writing and books should be
understood in divers nations and lands. And so Ranulphus, monk of
Chester (Ralph Higden), wrote in Latin his books of Chronicles, that
describeth the world about in length and in breadth, and maketh
mention and mind of doings and deeds of marvels and wonders, and
reckoneth the years to his last days from the first making of heaven
and of earth. And so therein is great and noble information and lore
to them that can therein read and understand. Therefore I would have
these books of Chronicles translated out of Latin into English, for
the more men should them understand and have thereof cunning,
information and lore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;These books of Chronicles be written in Latin, and Latin
is used and understood on this half Greece in all the nations and
lands of Europe. And commonly English is not so wide understood, ne
known; and the English translation should no man understand but
English men alone; then how should the more men understand the
Chronicles, though they were translated out of Latin, that is so wide
used and known, into English, that is not used and known but of
English men alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;This question and doubt is easy to assail. For if these
Chronicles were translated out of Latin into English, then by that so
many the more men should understand them as understand English, and no
Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;Ye can speak, read, and understand Latin; then it needeth
not to have such an English translation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;I deny this argument; for though I can speak, read, and
understand Latin, there is much Latin in these books of Chronicles
that I can not understand, neither thou, without studying, avisement,
and looking of other books. Also, though it were not needful for me,
it is needful for other men that understand no Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;Men that understand no Latin may learn and understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;Not all; for some may not for other manner business, some

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;Speak not too straitly of thing that needeth; for straitly
to speak of thing that needeth, only thing that is, and may not fail,

fail. And, so for to speak, no man needeth for to know the Chronicles,
for it might and may be that no man them knoweth. Otherwise to speak
of thing that needeth; somewhat needeth for to sustain or to have

needeth, all that is profitable needeth, and, so for to speak, all men

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;Then they that understand no Latin may ask and be informed
and ytaught of them that understand Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;Thou speakest wonderly, for the lewd man wots not what he
should ask, and namely of lore of deeds that come never in his mind;
nor wots of whom commonly he should ask. Also, not all men that
understand Latin have such books to inform lewd men; also some can
not, and some may not, have while, and so it needeth to have an
English translation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;The Latin is both good and fair, therefore it needeth not
to have an English translation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;The reason is worthy to be plunged in a pludde and laid in
powder of lewdness and of shame. It might well be that thou makest
only in mirth and in game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk.</span>&mdash;The reason must stand but it be assoiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord.</span>&mdash;A blear-eyed man, but he were all blind of wit, might see
the solution of this reason; and though he were blind he might grope
the solution, but if his feeling him failed. For if this reason were
aught worth, by such manner arguing men might prove that the three
score and ten interpreters, and Aquila, Symachus, Theodocion, and
Origines were lewdly occupied when they translated holy writ out of
Hebrew into Greek; and also that Saint Jerome was lewdly occupied when
he translated holy writ out of Hebrew into Latin, for the Hebrew is
both good and fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> and y-written by inspiration of the Holy Ghost;
and all these for their translations be highly praised of all Holy
Church. Then the foresaid lewd reason is worthy to be powdered, laid
a-water and y-soused. Also holy writ in Latin is both good and fair,
and yet for to make a sermon of holy writ all in Latin to men that can
English and no Latin, it were a lewd deed, for they be never the wiser
for the Latin, but it be told them in English what it is to mean; and
it may not be told in English what the Latin is to mean without
translation out of Latin into English. Then it needeth to have an
English translation, and for to keep it in mind that it be not
forgeten, it is better that such a translation be made and written
than said and not written. And so this foresaid lewd reason should
move no man that hath any wit to leave the making of English
translation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk</span>&mdash;A great deal of these books standeth much by holy writ, by
holy doctors, and by philosophy; then these books should not be
translated into English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord</span>&mdash;It is wonder that thou makest so feeble arguments, and hast
gone so long to school. Aristotle's books and other books also of
logic and of philosophy were translated out of Greek into Latin. Also
at praying of King Charles, John Scott translated Deny's books out of
Greek into Latin, and then out of Latin into French; then what hath
English trespassed that it might not be translated into English? Also
King Alured, that founded the University of Oxford, translated the
best laws into English tongue, and a great deal of the Psalter out of
Latin into English, and caused Wyrefrith, Bishop of Worcester, to
translate Saint Gregory's books, the dialogues, out of Latin into
Saxon. Also Caedmon of Whitby was inspired of the Holy Ghost, and made
wonder poesies in English nigh of all the stories of holy writ. Also
the holy man Beda translated St. John's gospel out of Latin into
English. Also thou wotest where the Apocalypse is written in the walls
and roof of a chapel, both in Latin and in French. Also the gospel,
and prophecy, and the right faith of holy church must be taught and
preached to English men that can no Latin. Then the gospel, and
prophecy, and the right faith of holy church must be told them in
English, and that is not done but by English translation, for such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
English preaching is very translation, and such English preaching is
good and needful; then English translation is good and needful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk</span>&mdash;If a translation were made that might be amended in any
point, some men it would blame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord</span>&mdash;If men blame that is not worthy to be blamed, then they be
to blame. Clerks know well enough that no sinful man doth so well that
it ne might do better, ne make so good a translation that he ne might
be better. Therefore Origines made two translations, and Jerome
translated thrice the Psalter. I desire not translation of these the
best that might be, for that were an idle desire for any man that is
now alive, but I would have a skilful translation, that might be known
and understood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk</span>&mdash;Whether is you liefer have, a translation of these
chronicles in rhyme or in prose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord</span>&mdash;In prose, for commonly prose is more clear than rhyme, more
easy and more plain to know and understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clerk</span>&mdash;Then God grant us grace grathly to gin, wit and wisdom
wisely to work, might and mind of right meaning to make translation
trusty and true, pleasing to the Trinity, three persons and one God,
in majesty, that ever was and ever shall be, and made heaven and
earth, and light for to shine, and departed light and darkness, and
called light, day, and darkness, night; and so was made eventide and
morrowtide one day, that had no morrowtide. The second day He made the
firmament between waters, and departed waters that were under the
firmament fro the waters that were above the firmament, and called the
firmament heaven. The third day He gathered waters that be under the
firmament into one place and made the earth unheled, and named the
gathering of waters, seas, and dry earth, land; and made trees and
grass. The fourth day he made sun and moon and stars, and set them in
the firmament of heaven there for to shine, and to be tokens and signs
to depart times and years, night and day. The fifth day He made fowls
and birds in the air, and fishes in the water. The sixth day He made
beasts of the land, and man of the earth, and put them in Paradise,
for he should work and wone therein. But man brake God's hest and fell
into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> sin, and was put out of Paradise into woe and sorrow, worthy to
be damned to the pain of hell without any end. But the Holy Trinity
had mercy of man, and the Father sent the Son, and the Holy Ghost
alight on a maid, and the Son took flesh and blood of that blissful
maid, and died on the Rood to save mankind, and arose the third day,
glorious and blissful, and taught his disciples, and ascended into
heaven when it was time; and shall come at the day of Doom and deem
quick and dead. Then all they that be written in the Book of Life
shall wend with Him into the bliss of heaven, and be there in body and
soul, and see and know His Godhead and Manhood in joy without any end.</p>

<h2><i>The Epistle of Sir John Trevisa, Chaplain unto Lord Thomas of Barkley, upon the translation of Polychronicon into our English tongue.</i></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/wscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="W" /></span>ealth and worship to my worthy and worshipful Lord Sir Thomas, Lord
of Barkley! I, John Trevisa, your priest and beadsman, obedient and
buxom to work your will, hold in heart, think in thought, and mean in
mind your needful meaning and speech that ye spake and said, that ye
would have English translation of Ranulphus of Chester's books of
chronicles. Therefore I will fond to take that travail, and make
English translation of the same books, as God granteth me grace, for
blame of backbiters will I not blinne; for envy of enemies, for evil
spiting and speech of evil speakers will I not leave to do this deed;
for travail will I not spare. Comfort I have in meedful making and
pleasing to God, and in knowing that I wot that it is your will for to
make this translation clear and plain to be known and understood. In
some place I shall set word for word, and active for active, and
passive for passive, a-row right as it standeth, without changing of
the order of words. But in some place I must change the order of
words, and set active for passive, and again-ward. And in some place I
must set a reason for a word, and tell what it meaneth. But for all
such changing, the meaning shall stand and not be changed. But some
words and names of countries, of lands, of cities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> of waters, of
rivers, of mountains and hills, of persons, and of places, must be set
and stand for themselves in their own kind, as Asia, Europe, Africa,
and Syria, Mount Atlas, Sindi, and Oreb, Marach, Jordan, and Arnon,
Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem, and Damascus, Hannibal, Rasin,
Ahasuerus, and Cyrus, and many such words and names. If any man make
of these books of chronicles a better English translation, and more
profitable, God do him meed! And because ye make me do this meedful
deed, He that quiteth all good deeds quite your meed in the bliss of
heaven, in wealth and liking, with all the holy saints of mankind and
the nine orders of angels; as Angels, Archangels, Principates,
Potestates, Virtutes, Dominations, Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim, to
see God in his blissful face, in joy without any end. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/hscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="H" /></span>ere beginneth the volume entitled and named the Recuyell of the
Histories of Troy, composed and drawn out of divers books of Latin
into French by the right venerable person and worshipful man, Raoul le
Feure, priest and chaplain unto the right noble, glorious, and mighty
prince in his time, Philip, Duke of Burgundy, of Brabant, etc., in the
year of the Incarnation of our Lord God a thousand four hundred sixty
and four, and translated and drawn out of French into English by
William Caxton, mercer, of the city of London, at the commandment of
the right high, mighty, and virtuous Princess, his redoubted Lady,
Margaret, by the grace of God Duchess of Burgundy, of Lotrylk, of
Brabant, etc.; which said translation and work was begun in Bruges in
the County of Flanders, the first day of March, the year of the
Incarnation of our said Lord God a thousand four hundred sixty and
eight, and ended and finished in the holy city of Cologne the 19th day
of September, the year of our said Lord God a thousand four hundred
sixty and eleven, etc.</p>

<p>And on that other side of this leaf followeth the prologue.</p>

<p>When I remember that every man is bounden by the commandment and
counsel of the wise man to eschew sloth and idleness, which is mother
and nourisher of vices, and ought to put myself unto virtuous
occupation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> business, then I, having no great charge of
occupation, following the said counsel took a French book, and read
therein many strange and marvellous histories, wherein I had great
pleasure and delight, as well for the novelty of the same as for the
fair language of French, which was in prose so well and compendiously
set and written, which methought I understood the sentence and
substance of every matter. And for so much as this book was new and
late made and drawn into French, and never had seen it in our English
tongue, I thought in myself it should be a good business to translate
it into our English, to the end that it might be had as well in the
royaume of England as in other lands, and also for to pass therewith
the time, and thus concluded in myself to begin this said work. And
forthwith took pen and ink, and began boldly to run forth as blind
Bayard in this present work, which is named "The Recuyell of the
Trojan Histories." And afterward when I remembered myself of my
simpleness and unperfectness that I had in both languages, that is to
wit in French and in English, for in France was I never, and was born
and learned my English in Kent, in the Weald, where I doubt not is
spoken as broad and rude English as in any place of England; and have
continued by the space of 30 years for the most part in the countries
of Brabant, Flanders, Holland, and Zealand. And thus when all these
things came before me, after that I had made and written five or six
quires I fell in despair of this work, and purposed no more to have
continued therein, and those quires laid apart, and in two years after
laboured no more in this work, and was fully in will to have left it,
till on a time it fortuned that the right high, excellent, and right
virtuous princess, my right redoubted Lady, my Lady Margaret, by the
grace of God sister unto the King of England and of France, my
sovereign lord, Duchess of Burgundy, of Lotryk, of Brabant, of
Limburg, and of Luxembourg, Countess of Flanders, of Artois, and of
Burgundy, Palatine of Hainault, of Holland, of Zealand and of Namur,
Marquesse of the Holy Empire, Lady of Frisia, of Salins and of
Mechlin, sent for me to speak with her good Grace of divers matters,
among the which I let her Highness have knowledge of the foresaid
beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> of this work, which anon commanded me to show the said five
or six quires to her said Grace; and when she had seen them anon she
found a default in my English, which she commanded me to amend, and
moreover commanded me straitly to continue and make an end of the
residue then not translated; whose dreadful commandment I durst in no
wise disobey, because I am a servant unto her said Grace and receive
of her yearly fee and other many good and great benefits, (and also
hope many more to receive of her Highness), but forthwith went and
laboured in the said translation after my simple and poor cunning,
also nigh as I can following my author, meekly beseeching the
bounteous Highness of my said Lady that of her benevolence list to
accept and take in gree this simple and rude work here following; and
if there be anything written or said to her pleasure, I shall think my
labour well employed, and whereas there is default that she arette it
to the simpleness of my cunning which is full small in this behalf;
and require and pray all them that shall read this said work to
correct it, and to hold me excused of the rude and simple translation.</p>

<p>And thus I end my prologue.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Epilogue to Book II.</b></p>

<p>Thus endeth the second book of the Recule of the Histories of Troy.
Which bookes were late translated into French out of Latin by the
labour of the venerable person Raoul le Feure, priest, as afore is
said; and by me indigne and unworthy, translated into this rude
English by the commandment of my said redoubted Lady, Duchess of
Burgundy. And for as much as I suppose the said two books be not had
before this time in our English language, therefore I had the better
will to accomplish this said work; which work was begun in Bruges and
continued in Ghent and finished in Cologne, in the time of the
troublous world, and of the great divisions being and reigning, as
well in the royaumes of England and France as in all other places
universally through the world; that is to wit the year of our Lord a
thousand four hundred seventy one. And as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> for the third book, which
treateth of the general and last destruction of Troy, it needeth not
to translate it into English, for as much as that worshipful and
religious man, Dan John Lidgate, monk of Bury, did translate it but
late; after whose work I fear to take upon me, that am not worthy to
bear his penner and ink-horn after him, to meddle me in that work. But
yet for as much as I am bound to contemplate my said Lady's good
grace, and also that his work is in rhyme and as far as I know it is
not had in prose in our tongue, and also, peradventure, he translated
after some other author than this is; and yet for as much as divers
men be of divers desires, some to read in rhyme and metre and some in
prose; and also because that I have now good leisure, being in
Cologne, and have none other thing to do at this time; in eschewing of
idleness, mother of all vices, I have delibered in myself for the
contemplation of my said redoubted lady to take this labour in hand,
by the sufferance and help of Almighty God; whom I meekly supplye to
give me grace to accomplish it to the pleasure of her that is causer
thereof, and that she receive it in gree of me, her faithful, true,
and most humble servant, etc.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Epilogue to Book III.</b></p>

<p>Thus end I this book, which I have translated after mine Author as
nigh as God hath given me cunning, to whom be given the laud and
praising. And for as much as in the writing of the same my pen is
worn, my hand weary and not steadfast, mine eyne dimmed with overmuch
looking on the white paper, and my courage not so prone and ready to
labour as it hath been, and that age creepeth on me daily and feebleth
all the body, and also because I have promised to divers gentlemen and
to my friends to address to them as hastily as I might this said book,
therefore I have practised and learned at my great charge and dispense
to ordain this said book in print, after the manner and form as ye may
here see, and is not written with pen and ink as other books be, to
the end that every man may have them at once. For all the books of
this story, named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> "The Recule of the Histories of Troy" thus
imprinted as ye here see, were begun in one day and also finished in
one day, which book I have presented to my said redoubted Lady, as
afore is said. And she hath well accepted it, and largely rewarded me,
wherefore I beseech Almighty God to reward her everlasting bliss after
this life, praying her said Grace and all them that shall read this
book not to disdain the simple and rude work, neither to reply against
the saying of the matters touched in this book, though it accord not
unto the translation of others which have written it. For divers men
have made divers books which in all points accord not, as Dictes,
Dares, and Homer. For Dictes and Homer, as Greeks, say and write
favourably for the Greeks, and give to them more worship than to the
Trojans; and Dares writeth otherwise than they do. And also as for the
proper names, it is no wonder that they accord not, for some one name
in these days have divers equivocations after the countries that they
dwell in; but all accord in conclusion the general destruction of that
noble city of Troy, and the death of so many noble princes, as kings,
dukes, earls, barons, knights, and common people, and the ruin
irreparable of that city that never since was re-edified; which may be
example to all men during the world how dreadful and jeopardous it is
to begin a war, and what harms, losses, and death followeth. Therefore
the Apostle saith: "All that is written is written to our doctrine,"
which doctrine for the common weal I beseech God may be taken in such
place and time as shall be most needful in increasing of peace, love,
and charity; which grant us He that suffered for the same to be
crucified on the rood tree. And say we all Amen for charity!</p>

<h2><a name="Dictes" id="Dictes"></a><i>Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers.</i></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/hscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="H" /></span>ere endeth
the book named <i>The Dictes or Sayings of the
Philosophers</i>, imprinted by me, William Caxton, at Westminster, the
year of our Lord 1477. Which book is late translated out of French
into English by the noble and puissant Lord Lord Antony, Earl of
Rivers, Lord of Scales, and of the Isle of Wight, defender and
director of the siege apostolic for our holy father the Pope in this
royaume of England, and governor of my Lord Prince of Wales. And it is
so that at such time as he had accomplished this said work, it liked
him to send it to me in certain quires to oversee, which forthwith I
saw, and found therein many great, notable, and wise sayings of the
philosophers, according unto the books made in French which I had
often before read; but certainly I had seen none in English until that
time. And so afterward I came unto my said Lord, and told him how I
had read and seen his book, and that he had done a meritorious deed in
the labour of the translation thereof into our English tongue, wherein
he had deserved a singular laud and thanks, &amp;c. Then my said Lord
desired me to oversee it, and where I should find fault to correct it;
whereon I answered unto his Lordship that I could not amend it, but if
I should so presume I might apaire it, for it was right well and
cunningly made and translated into right good and fair English.
Notwithstanding, he willed me to oversee it, and shewed me divers
things, which, as seemed to him, might be left out, as divers letters
missives sent from Alexander to Darius and Aristotle, and each to
other, which letters were little appertinent unto dictes and sayings
aforesaid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> forasmuch as they specify of other matters. And also
desired me, that done, to put the said book in imprint. And thus
obeying his request and commandment, I have put me in devoir to
oversee this his said book, and behold as nigh as I could how it
accordeth with the original, being in French. And I find nothing
discordant therein, save only in the dictes and sayings of Socrates,
wherein I find that my said Lord hath left out certain and divers
conclusions touching women. Whereof I marvel that my Lord hath not
written them, ne what hath moved him so to do, ne what cause he had at
that time; but I suppose that some fair lady hath desired him to leave
it out of his book; or else he was amorous on some noble lady, for
whose love he would not set it in his book; or else for the very
affection, love, and good will that he hath unto all ladies and
gentlewomen, he thought that Socrates spared the sooth and wrote of
women more than truth; which I cannot think that so true a man and so
noble a philosopher as Socrates was should write otherwise than truth.
For if he had made fault in writing of women, he ought not, ne should
not, be believed in his other dictes and sayings. But I perceive that
my said Lord knoweth verily that such defaults be not had ne found in
the women born and dwelling in these parts ne regions of the world.
Socrates was a Greek, born in a far country from hence, which country
is all of other conditions than this is, and men and women of other
nature than they be here in this country. For I wot well, of
whatsoever condition women be in Greece, the women of this country be
right good, wise, pleasant, humble, discreet, sober, chaste, obedient
to their husbands, true, secret, steadfast, ever busy, and never idle,
attemperate in speaking, and virtuous in all their works&mdash;or at least
should be so. For which causes so evident my said Lord, as I suppose,
thought it was not of necessity to set in his book the sayings of his
author Socrates touching women. But forasmuch as I had commandment of
my said Lord to correct and amend where I should find fault, and other
find I none save that he hath left out these dictes and sayings of the
women of Greece, therefore in accomplishing his commandment&mdash;forasmuch
as I am not certain whether it was in my Lord's copy or not, or else,
peradventure, that the wind had blown over the leaf at the time of
translation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> of his book&mdash;I purpose to write those same sayings of
that Greek Socrates, which wrote of the women of Greece and nothing of
them of this royaume, whom, I suppose, he never knew; for if he had, I
dare plainly say that he would have reserved them specially in his
said dictes. Always not presuming to put and set them in my said
Lord's book but in the end apart in the rehearsal of the works, humbly
requiring all them that shall read this little rehearsal, that if they
find any fault to arette it to Socrates, and not to me, which writeth
as hereafter followeth.</p>

<p>Socrates said that women be the apparels to catch men, but they take
none but them that will be poor or else them that know them not. And
he said that there is none so great empechement unto a man as
ignorance and women. And he saw a woman that bare fire, of whom he
said that the hotter bore the colder. And he saw a woman sick, of whom
he said that the evil resteth and dwelleth with the evil. And he saw a
woman brought to the justice, and many other women followed her
weeping, of whom he said the evil be sorry and angry because the evil
shall perish. And he saw a young maid that learned to write, of whom
he said that men multiplied evil upon evil. And he said that the
ignorance of a man is known in three things, that is to wit, when he
hath no thought to use reason; when he cannot refrain his covetise;
and when he is governed by the counsel of women, in that he knoweth
that they know not. And he said unto his disciples: "Will ye that I
enseign and teach you how ye shall now escape from all evil?" And they
answered, "Yea." And then he said to them, "For whatsoever thing that
it be, keep you and be well ware that ye obey not women." Who answered
to him again, "And what sayest thou by our good mothers, and of our
sisters?" He said to them, "Suffice you with that I have said to you,
for all be semblable in malice." And he said, "Whosoever will acquire
and get science, let him never put him in the governance of a woman."
And he saw a woman that made her fresh and gay, to whom he said, "Thou
resemblest the fire; for the more wood is laid to the fire the more
will it burn, and the greater is the heat." And on a time one asked
him what him semed of women; he answered that the women resemble a
tree called Edelfla,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> which is the fairest tree to behold and see that
may be, but within it is full of venom. And they said to him and
demanded wherefore he blamed so women? and that he himself had not
come into this world, ne none other men also, without them. He
answered, "The woman is like unto a tree named Chassoygnet, on which
tree there be many things sharp and pricking, which hurt and prick
them that approach unto it; and yet, nevertheless, that same tree
bringeth forth good dates and sweet." And they demanded him why he
fled from the women? And he answered, "Forasmuch as I see them flee
and eschew the good and commonly do evil." And a woman said to him,
"Wilt thou have any other woman than me?" And he answered to her, "Art
not ashamed to offer thyself to him that demandeth nor desireth thee
not?"</p>

<p>So, these be the dictes and sayings of the philosopher Socrates, which
he wrote in his book; and certainly he wrote no worse than afore is
rehearsed. And forasmuch as it is accordant that his dictes and
sayings should be had as well as others', therefore I have set it in
the end of this book. And also some persons, peradventure, that have
read this book in French would have arette a great default in me that
I had not done my devoir in visiting and overseeing of my Lord's book
according to his desire. And some other also, haply, might have
supposed that Socrates had written much more ill of women than here
afore is specified, wherefore in satisfying of all parties, and also
for excuse of the said Socrates, I have set these said dictes and
sayings apart in the end of this book, to the intent that if my said
lord or any other person, whatsoever he or she be that shall read or
hear it, that if they be not well pleased withal, that they with a pen
race it out, or else rend the leaf out of the book. Humbly requiring
and beseeching my said lord to take no displeasure on me so presuming,
but to pardon whereas he shall find fault; and that it please him to
take the labour of the imprinting in gree and thanks, which gladly
have done my diligence in the accomplishing of his desire and
commandment; in which I am bounden so to do for the good reward that I
have received of his said lordship; whom I beseech Almighty God to
increase and to continue in his virtuous disposition in this world,
and after this life to live everlastingly in Heaven. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/tscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="T" /></span>hus endeth
this book, which is named "The Book of Consolation of
Philosophy," which that Boecius made for his comfort and consolation,
he being in exile for the common and public weal, having great
heaviness and thoughtes, and in manner of despair, rehearsing in the
said book how Philosophy appeared to him shewing the mutability of
this transitory life, and also informing how fortune and hap should be
understood, with the predestination and prescience of God as much as
may and is possible to be known naturally, as afore is said in this
said book. Which Boecius was an excellent author of divers books,
craftily and curiously made in prose and metre; and also had
translated divers books out of Greek into Latin, and had been senator
of that noble and famous city Rome; and also his two sons senators for
their prudence and wisdom. And forasmuch as he withstood to his power
the tyranny of Theodoric, then Emperor, and would have defended the
said city and senate from his wicked hands, whereupon he was convicted
and put in prison; in which prison he made this foresaid book of
consolation for his singular comfort. And forasmuch as the style of it
is hard and difficult to be understood of simple persons, therefore
the worshipful father and first founder and embellisher of ornate
eloquence in our English, I mean Master Geoffrey Chaucer, hath
translated this said work out of Latin into our usual and mother
tongue, following the Latin as nigh as is possible to be understood;
wherein in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> mine opinion he hath deserved a perpetual laud and thank
of all this noble royaume of England, and especially of them that
shall read and understand it. For in the said book they may see what
this transitory and mutable world is, and whereto every man living in
it ought to intend. Then forasmuch as this said book so translated is
rare and not spread ne known as it is digne and worthy, for the
erudition and learning as such as be ignorant and not knowing of it,
at request of a singular friend and gossip of mine, I, William Caxton,
have done my devoir and pain to imprint it in form as is here afore
made; in hoping that it shall profit much people to the weal and
health of their souls, and for to learn to have and keep the better
patience in adversities. And furthermore I desire and require you that
of your charity ye would pray for the soul of the said worshipful man
Geoffrey Chaucer, first translator of this said book into English, and
embellisher in making the said language ornate and fair, which shall
endure perpetually; and therefore he ought eternally to be remembered,
of whom the body and corpse lieth buried in the Abbey of Westminster
beside London, to-fore the chapel of Saint Benedict, by whose
sepulchre is written on a table hanging on a pillar his Epitaph, made

<h2><a name="Golden_Legend" id="Golden_Legend"></a><i>Golden Legend.</i></h2>

<p class="center"><b>First Edition (1483). Prologue.</b></p>


<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/tscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="T" /></span>he Holy
and blessed doctor Saint Jerome saith this authority, "Do
always some good work to the end that the devil find thee not Idle."
And the holy doctor Saint Austin saith in the book of the labour of
monks, that no man strong or mighty to labour ought to be idle; for
which cause when I had performed and accomplished divers works and
histories translated out of French into English at the request of
certain lords, ladies, and gentlemen, as the Recuyel of the History of
Troy, the Book of the Chess, the History of Jason, the history of the
Mirror of the World, the 15 books of Metamorphoses in which be
contained the fables of Ovid, and the History of Godfrey of Boulogne
in the conquest of Jerusalem, with other divers works and books, I ne
wist what work to begin and put forth after the said works to-fore
made. And forasmuch as idleness is so much blamed, as saith Saint
Bernard, the mellifluous doctor, that she is mother of lies and
step-dame of virtues, and it is she that overthroweth strong men into
sin, quencheth virtue, nourisheth pride, and maketh the way ready to
go to hell; and John Cassiodorus saith that the thought of him that is
idle thinketh on none other thing but on licorous meats and viands for
his belly; and the holy Saint Bernard aforesaid saith in an epistle,
when the time shall come that it shall behove us to render and give
accounts of our idle time, what reason may we render or what answer
shall we give when in idleness is none excuse; and Prosper saith that
whosoever liveth in idleness liveth in manner of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> dumb beast. And
because I have seen the authorities that blame and despise so much
idleness, and also know well that it is one of the capital and deadly
sins much hateful unto God, therefore I have concluded and firmly
purposed in myself no more to be idle, but will apply myself to labour
and such occupation as I have been accustomed to do. And forasmuch as
Saint Austin aforesaid saith upon a psalm that good work ought not to
be done for fear of pain, but for the love of righteousness, and that
it be of very and sovereign franchise, and because me-seemeth to be a
sovereign weal to incite and exhort men and women to keep them from
sloth and idleness, and to let to be understood to such people as be
not lettered the nativities, the lives, the passions, the miracles,
and the death of the holy saints, and also some other notorious deeds
and acts of times past, I have submised myself to translate into
English the legend of Saints, which is called <i>Legenda Aurea</i> in
Latin, that is to say, the <i>Golden Legend</i>; for in like wise as gold
is most noble above all other metals, in like wise is this legend
holden most noble above all other works. Against me here might some
persons say that this legend hath been translated before, and truth it
is; but forasmuch as I had by me a legend in French, another in Latin,
and the third in English, which varied in many and divers places, and
also many histories were comprised in the two other books which were
not in the English book; and therefore I have written one out of the
said three books, which I have ordered otherwise than the said English
legend is, which was so to-fore made, beseeching all them that shall
see or hear it read to pardon me where I have erred or made fault,
which, if any be, is of ignorance and against my will; and submit it
wholly of such as can and may, to correct it, humbly beseeching them
so to do, and in so doing they shall deserve a singular laud and
merit; and I shall pray for them unto Almighty God that He of His
benign grace reward them, etc., and that it profit to all them that
shall read or hear it read, and may increase in them virtue, and expel
vice and sin, that by the example of the holy saints amend their
living here in this short life, that by their merits they and I may
come to everlasting life and bliss in Heaven. Amen.</p>

<h2><a name="Caton" id="Caton"></a><i>Caton</i> (1483).</h2>

<p class="center"><b>Prologue.</b></p>


<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/hscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" alt="H" /></span>ere beginneth
the prologue or proem of the book called <i>Caton</i>, which
book hath been translated into English by Master Benet Burgh, late
Archdeacon of Colchester, and high canon of St. Stephen's at
Westminster, which ful craftily hath made it in ballad royal for the
erudition of my lord Bousher, son and heir at that time to my lord the
Earl of Essex. And because of late came to my hand a book of the said
Cato in French, which rehearseth many a fair learning and notable
examples, I have translated it out of French into English, as all
along hereafter shall appear, which I present unto the city of London.</p>

<p>Unto the noble, ancient, and renowned city, the city of London, in
England, I, William Caxton, citizen and conjury of the same, and of
the fraternity and fellowship of the mercery, owe of right my service
and good will, and of very duty am bounden naturally to assist, aid,
and counsel, as far forth as I can to my power, as to my mother of
whom I have received my nurture and living, and shall pray for the
good prosperity and policy of the same during my life. For, as
me-seemeth, it is of great need, because I have known it in my young
age much more wealthy, prosperous, and richer, than it is at this day.
And the cause is that there is almost none that intendeth to the
common weal, but only every man for his singular profit. Oh! when I
remember the noble Romans, that for the common weal of the city of
Rome they spent not only their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> moveable goods but they put their
bodies and lives in jeopardy and to the death, as by many a noble
example we may see in the acts of Romans, as of the two noble Scipios,
African and Asian, Actilius, and many others. And among all others the
noble Cato, author and maker of this book, which he hath left for to
remain ever to all the people for to learn in it and to know how every
man ought to rule and govern him in this life, as well for the life
temporal as for the life spiritual. And as in my judgement it is the
best book for to be taught to young children in school, and also to
people of every age, it is full convenient if it be well understood.
And because I see that the children that be born within the said city
increase, and profit not like their fathers and elders, but for the
most part after that they be come to their perfect years of discretion
and ripeness of age, how well that their fathers have left to them
great quantity of goods yet scarcely among ten two thrive, [whereas] I
have seen and known in other lands in divers cities that of one name
and lineage successively have endured prosperously many heirs, yea, a
five or six hundred years, and some a thousand; and in this noble city
of London it can unneth continue unto the third heir or scarcely to
the second,&mdash;O blessed Lord, when I remember this I am all abashed; I
cannot judge the cause, but fairer ne wiser ne better spoken children
in their youth be nowhere than there be in London, but at their full
ripening there is no kernel ne good corn found, but chaff for the most
part. I wot well there be many noble and wise, and prove well and be
better and richer than ever were their fathers. And to the end that
many might come to honour and worship, I intend to translate this said
book of Cato, in which I doubt not, and if they will read it and
understand they shall much the better con rule themselves thereby; for
among all other books this is a singular book, and may well be called
the regiment or governance of the body and soul.</p>

<p>There was a noble clerk named Pogius of Florence, and was secretary to
Pope Eugene and also to Pope Nicholas, which had in the city of
Florence a noble and well-stuffed library which all noble strangers
coming to Florence desired to see; and therein they found many noble
and rare books. And when they had asked of him which was the best
book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> of them all, and that he reputed for best, he said that he held
Cato glosed for the best book of his library. Then since that he that
was so noble a clerk held this book for the best, doubtless it must
follow that this is a noble book and a virtuous, and such one that a
man may eschew all vices and ensue virtue. Then to the end that this
said book may profit unto the hearers of it, I beseech Almighty God
that I may achieve and accomplish it unto his laud and glory, and to
the erudition and learning of them that be ignorant, that they may
thereby profit and be the better. And I require and beseech all such
that find fault or error, that of their charity they correct and amend
it, and I shall heartily pray for them to Almighty God, that he reward
them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/nscroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="N" /></span>ow then
I will finish all these fables with this tale that followeth,
which a worshipful priest and a parson told me lately. He said that
there were dwelling in Oxford two priests, both masters of art, of
whom that one was quick and could put himself forth, and that other
was a good simple priest. And so it happened that the master that was
pert and quick, was anon promoted to a benefice or twain, and after to
prebends and for to be a dean of a great prince's chapel, supposing
and weening that his fellow the simple priest should never have been
promoted, but be alway an Annual, or at the most a parish priest. So
after long time that this worshipful man, this dean, came riding into
a good parish with a ten or twelve horses, like a prelate, and came
into the church of the said parish, and found there this good simple
man sometime his fellow, which came and welcomed him lowly; and that
other bad him "good morrow, master John," and took him slightly by the
hand, and asked him where he dwelt. And the good man said, "In this
parish." "How," said he, "are ye here a soul priest or a parish
priest?" "Nay, sir," said he, "for lack of a better, though I be not
able ne worthy, I am parson and curate of this parish." And then that
other availed his bonnet and said, "Master parson, I pray you to be
not displeased; I had supposed ye had not been beneficed; but master,"
said he, "I pray you what is this benefice worth to you a year?"
"Forsooth," said the good simple man, "I wot never, for I make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> never
accounts thereof how well I have had it four or five years." "And know
ye not," said he, "what it is worth? it should seem a good benefice."
"No, forsooth" said he, "but I wot well what it shall be worth to me."
"Why" said he, "what shall it be worth?" "Forsooth" said he, "if I do
my true diligence in the cure of my parishioners in preaching and
teaching, and do my part longing to my cure, I shall have heaven
therefore; and if their souls be lost, or any of them by my default, I
shall be punished therefore, and hereof am I sure." And with that word
the rich dean was abashed, and thought he should do the better and
take more heed to his cures and benefices than he had done. This was a
good answer of a good priest and an honest. And herewith I finish this
book, translated and printed by me, William Caxton, at Westminster in
the Abbey, and finished the 26th day of March, the year of our Lord
1484, and the first year of the reign of King Richard the Third.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/gflower.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="G" /></span>reat thanks,
laud, and honour ought to be given unto the clerks,
poets, and historiographs that have written many noble books of
wisedom of the lives, passions, and miracles of holy saints, of
histories of noble and famous acts and faites, and of the chronicles
since the beginning of the creation of the world unto this present
time, by which we be daily informed and have knowledge of many things
of whom we should not have known if they had not left to us their
monuments written. Among whom and in especial before all others, we
ought to give a singular laud unto that noble and great philosopher
Geoffrey Chaucer, the which for his ornate writing in our tongue may
well have the name of a laureate poet. For to-fore that he by labour
embellished, ornated, and made fair our English, in this realm was had
rude speech and incongruous, as yet it appeareth by old books, which
at this day ought not to have place ne be compared among, ne to, his
beauteous volumes and ornate writings, of whom he made many books and
treatises of many a noble history, as well in metre as in rhyme and
prose; and them so craftily made that he comprehended his matters in
short, quick, and high sentences, eschewing prolixity, casting away
the chaff of superfluity, and shewing the picked grain of sentence
uttered by crafty and sugared eloquence; of whom among all others of
his books I purpose to print, by the grace of God, the book of the
tales of Canterbury, in which I find many a noble history of every
state and degree; first rehearsing the conditions and the array of
each of them as properly as possible is to be said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> And after their
tales which be of nobleness, wisdom, gentleness, mirth, and also of
very holiness and virtue, wherein he finisheth this said book, which
book I have diligently overseen and duly examined, to that end it be
made according unto his own making. For I find many of the said books
which writers have abridged it, and many things left out; and in some
place have set certain verses that he never made ne set in his book;
of which books so incorrect was one brought to me, 6 years past, which
I supposed had been very true and correct; and according to the same I
did do imprint a certain number of them, which anon were sold to many
and divers gentlemen, of whom one gentleman came to me and said that
this book was not according in many place unto the book that Geoffrey
Chaucer had made. To whom I answered that I had made it according to
my copy, and by me was nothing added ne minished. Then he said he knew
a book which his father had and much loved, that was very true and
according unto his own first book by him made; and said more, if I
would imprint it again he would get me the same book for a copy,
howbeit he wist well that his father would not gladly depart from it.
To whom I said, in case that he could get me such a book, true and
correct, yet I would once endeavour me to imprint it again for to
satisfy the author, whereas before by ignorance I erred in hurting and
defaming his book in divers places, in setting in some things that he
never said ne made, and leaving out many things that he made which be
requisite to be set in it. And thus we fell at accord, and he full
gently got of his father the said book and delivered it to me, by
which I have corrected my book, as hereafter, all along by the aid of
Almighty God, shall follow; whom I humbly beseech to give me grace and
aid to achieve and accomplish to his laud, honour, and glory; and that
all ye that shall in this book read or hear, will of your charity
among your deeds of mercy remember the soul of the said Geoffrey
Chaucer, first author and maker of this book. And also that all we
that shall see and read therein may so take and understand the good
and virtuous tales, that it may so profit unto the health of our souls
that after this short and transitory life we may come to everlasting
life in Heaven. Amen.</p>

<h2><a name="Malorys" id="Malorys"></a><i>Malory's King Arthur</i>. (1485).</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>Prologue.</strong></p>


<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/ascroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="A" /></span>fter that
I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well
of contemplation as of other historical and worldly acts of great
conquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and
doctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England
came and demanded me many and oft times wherefore that I have not done
made and printed the noble history of the Saint Graal, and of the most
renowned Christian King, first and chief of the three best Christian
and worthy, Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us
Englishmen before all other Christian Kings. For it is notoyrly known
through the universal world that there be nine worthy and the best
that ever were; that is to wit three Paynims, three Jews, and three
Christian men. As for the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation
of Christ, which were named&mdash;the first, Hector of Troy, of whom the
history is come both in ballad and in prose&mdash;the second, Alexander the
Great; and the third, Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the
histories be well known and had. And as for the three Jews, which also
were before the Incarnation of our Lord of whom the first was Duke
Joshua, which brought the children of Israel into the land of behest;
the second, David, King of Jerusalem; and the third Judas Maccab&aelig;us;
of these three the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and
acts. And since the said Incarnation have been three noble Christian
men, installed and admitted through the universal world into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> the
number of the nine best and worthy, of whom was first the noble
Arthur, whose noble acts I purpose to write in this present book here
following. The second was Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, of whom
the history is had in many places both in French and English; and the
third and last was Godfrey of Boulogne, of whose acts and life I made
a book unto the excellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward
the Fourth. The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to print
the history of the said noble king and conqueror, King Arthur, and of
his knights, with the history of the Saint Graal, and of the death and
ending of the said Arthur, affirming that I ought rather to print his
acts and noble feats than of Godfrey of Boulogne or any of the other
eight, considering that he was a man born within this realm, and king
and emperor of the same; and that there be in French divers and many
noble volumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered
that divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that
all such books as be made of him be but feigned and fables, because
that some chronicles make of him no mention, ne remember him nothing,
ne of his knights; whereto they answered, and one in special said,
that in him that should say or think that there was never such a king
called Arthur, might well be aretted great folly and blindness; for he
said that there were many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see
his sepulchre in the monastery of Glastonbury; and also in
'Polychronicon,' in the fifth book, the sixth chapter, and in the
seventh book, the twenty-third chapter, where his body was buried, and
after found and translated into the said monastery. Ye shall see also
in the history of Boccaccio, in his book 'De casu principum,' part of
his noble acts and also of his fall. Also Galfridus in his British
book recounteth his life, and in divers places of England many
remembrances be yet of him, and shall remain perpetually, and also of
his knights. First in the Abbey of Westminster at Saint Edward's
shrine remaineth the print of his seal in red wax closed in beryl, in
which is written 'Patricius Arthurus, Britanniae Galliae Germaniae
Daciae Imperator.' Item, in the castle of Dover ye may see Gawain's
skull and Caradoc's mantle; at Winchester the round table; in other
places Lancelot's sword,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> and many other things. Then all these things
considered, there can no man reasonably gainsay but here was a king of
this land named Arthur; for in all places, Christian and heathen, he
is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the first of the
three Christian men. And also he is more spoken of beyond the sea;
more books made of his noble acts than there be in England, as well in
Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greek as in French; and yet of record
remain in witness of him in Wales in the town of Camelot the great
stones and marvellous works of iron lying under the ground, and royal
vaults, which divers now living hath seen. Wherefore it is a marvel
why he is no more renowned in his own country, save only it accordeth
to the word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a prophet
in his own country. Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I could
not well deny but that there was such a noble king named Arthur, and
reputed one of the nine worthy, and first and chief of the Christian
men; and many noble volumes be made of him and of his noble knights in
French, which I have seen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in
our maternal tongue, but in Welsh be many, and also in French, and
some in English, but nowhere nigh all. Wherefore such as have lately
been drawn out briefly into English, I have, after the simple cunning
that God hath sent to me, under the favour and correction of all noble
lords and gentlemen, emprised to imprint a book of the noble histories
of the said King Arthur and of certain of his knights, after a copy
unto me delivered, which copy Sir Thomas Mallory did take out of
certain books of French and reduced it into English. And I according
to my copy have down set it in print, to the intent that noble men may
see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous
deeds that some knights used in those days, by which they came to
honour, and how they that were vicious were punished and oft put to
shame and rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble lords and ladies and all
other estates, of what estate or degree they be of, that shall see and
read in this said book and work, that they take the good and honest
acts in their remembrance and to follow the same, wherein they shall
find many joyous and pleasant histories and noble and renowned acts of
humanity, gentleness, and chivalry. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> herein may be seen noble
chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardyhood, love,
friendship, cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the
good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and
renown. And for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read
in; but for to give faith and believe that all is true that is
contained herein, ye be at your liberty. But all is written for our
doctrine, and for to beware that we fall not to vice ne sin, but to
exercise and follow virtue, by which we may come and attain to good
fame and renown in this life, and after this short and transitory life
to come unto everlasting bliss in heaven; the which He grant us that
reigneth in Heaven, the Blessed Trinity. Amen.</p>

<p>Then to proceed forth in this said book which I direct unto all noble

<h2><a name="Eneydos" id="Eneydos"></a><i>Eneydos</i> (1490).</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>Prologue.</strong></p>


<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/ascroll.png" style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="A" /></span>fter divers
work made, translated, and achieved, having no work in
hand, I sitting in my study whereas lay many divers pamphlets and
books, happened that to my hand came a little book in French, which
lately was translated out of Latin by some noble clerk of France,
which book is named <i>Aeneidos</i>, made in Latin by that noble poet and
great clerk, Virgil. Which book I saw over, and read therein how,
after the general destruction of the great Troy, Aeneas departed,
bearing his old father Anchises upon his shoulders, his little son
Iulus on his hand, his wife with much other people following, and how
he shipped and departed, with all the history of his adventures that
he had ere he came to the achievement of his conquest of Italy, as all
along shall be shewed in his present book. In which book I had great
pleasure because of the fair and honest terms and words in French;
which I never saw before like, ne none so pleasant ne so well ordered;
which book as seemed to me should be much requisite to noble men to
see, as well for the eloquence as the histories. How well that many
hundred years past was the said book of <i>Aeneidos</i>, with other works,
made and learned daily in schools, especially in Italy and other
places; which history the said Virgil made in metre. And when I had
advised me in this said book, I delibered and concluded to translate
it into English; and forthwith took a pen and ink and wrote a leaf or
twain, which I oversaw again to correct it. And when I saw the fair
and strange terms therein, I doubted that it should not please some
gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> which late blamed me, saying that in my translations I had
over curious terms, which could not be understood of common people,
and desired me to use old and homely terms in my translations. And
fain would I satisfy every man, and so to do took an old book and read
therein, and certainly the English was so rude and broad that I could
not well understood it. And also my Lord Abbot of Westminster did do
show to me lately certain evidences written in old English, for to
reduce it into our English now used. And certainly it was written in
such wise that it was more like to Dutch than English, I could not
reduce ne bring it to be understood. And certainly our language now
used varieth far from that which was used and spoken when I was born.
For we Englishmen be born under the domination of the moon, which is
never steadfast but ever wavering, waxing one season and waneth and
decreaseth another season. And that common English that is spoken in
one shire varieth from another, insomuch that in my days happened that
certain merchants were in a ship in Thames for to have sailed over the
sea into Zealand, and for lack of wind they tarried at Foreland, and
went to land for to refresh them. And one of them named Sheffield, a
mercer, came into a house and asked for meat, and especially he asked
after eggs; and the goodwife answered that she could speak no French,
and the merchant was angry, for he also could speak no French, but
would have had eggs, and she understood him not. And then at last
another said, that he would have "eyren"; then the goodwife said that
she understood him well. Lo, what should a man in these days now
write, eggs or eyren? Certainly it is hard to please every man because
of diversity and change of language. For in these days every man that
is in any reputation in his country will utter his communication and
matters in such manners and terms that few men shall understand them.
And some honest and great clerks have been with me and desired me to
write the most curious terms that I could find; and thus between
plain, rude and curious I stand abashed. But in my judgment the common
terms that be daily used be lighter to be understood than the old and
ancient English. And forasmuch as this present book is not for a rude
uplandish man to labour therein ne read it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> but only for a clerk and
a noble gentleman that feeleth and understandeth in feats of arms, in
love and in noble chivalry. Therefore in a mean between both I have
reduced and translated this said book into our English, not over-rude
ne curious; but in such terms as shall be understood, by God's grace,
according to my copy. And if any man will intermit in reading of it,
and findeth such terms that he cannot understand, let him go read and
learn Virgil or the pistles of Ovid, and there he shall see and
understand lightly all, if he have a good reader and informer. For
this book is not for every rude and uncunning man to see, but to
clerks and very gentlemen that understand gentleness and science. Then
I pray all them that shall read in this little treatise to hold me for
excused for the translating of it, for I acknowledge myself ignorant
of cunning to emprise on me so high and noble a work. But I pray
Master John Skelton, late created poet laureate in the University of
Oxenford, to oversee and correct this said book, and to address and
expound, wherever shall be found fault, to them that shall require it.</p>

<p>For him I know for sufficient to expound and English every difficulty
that is therein; for he hath lately translated the Epistles of Tully,
and the book of Diodorus Siculus, and divers other works out of Latin
into English, not in rude and old language, but in polished and ornate
terms craftily, as he that hath read Virgil, Ovid, Tully, and all the
other noble poets and orators to me unknown. And also he hath read the
nine Muses, and understands their musical sciences, and to whom of
them each science is appropred. I suppose he hath drunken of Helicon's
well. Then I pray him and such others to correct, add, or minish
whereas he or they shall find fault; for I have but followed my copy
in French as nigh as to me is possible. And if any word be said
therein well, I am glad; and if otherwise, I submit my said book to
their correction. Which book I present unto the high born, my
to-coming natural and sovereign lord Arthur, by the grace of God
Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester, first-begotten
son and heir unto our most dread natural and sovereign lord and most
Christian King, Henry the <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, by the grace of God King of England
and of France, and lord of Ireland; beseeching his noble Grace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> to
receive it in thank of me his most humble subject and servant. And I
shall pray unto Almighty God for his prosperous increasing in virtue,
wisedom, and humanity, that he may be equal with the most renowned of
all his noble progenitors; and so to live in this present life that
after this transitory life he and we all may come to everlasting life
in Heaven. Amen.</p>

With mirth and solace they made good cheer<br />

And after, as I heard them tell,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">SONG 1.</span><br />
As I out rode this enderes night,<br />
Of three jolly shepherds I saw a sight,<br />
And all about their fold a star shone bright;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sang terli, terlow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">SONG 2.</span><br />
Lully, lullay, thou little tiny child,<br />
By by, lully, lullay, thou little tiny child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By by, lully, lullay!</span><br />
<br />
O sisters two,<br />
How may we do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to preserve this day</span><br />
This poor youngling,<br />
For whom we do sing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By by, lully, lullay?</span><br />

Herod the King,<br />
In his raging,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charged he hath this day</span><br />
His men of might,<br />
In his own sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All young children to slay,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
That woe is me,<br />
Poor child for thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ever mourn, and may,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">SONG 3.</span><br />
Down from heaven, from heaven so high,<br />
Of angels there came a great company,<br />
With mirth and joy and great solemnity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sang terli, terlow,</span><br />
So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.</p></div>

<h3>[From <span class="smcap">John Skot</span>'s Editions,</h3>
<h3>c. 1525.]</h3>

<div class="poem"><p class="hang">Here beginneth a treatise how the High Father of Heaven sendeth Death
to summon every creature to come and give a count of their lives in this world, and is in manner of a moral play.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="play">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I pray you all give your audience,<br />
And hear this matter with reverence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By figure a moral play.</span><br />
'The summoning of Everyman' called it is,<br />
That of our lives and ending shows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How transitory we be all day.</span><br />
This matter is wondrous precious,<br />
But the intent of it is more gracious<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sweet to bear away.</span><br />
This story saith 'man, in the beginning<br />
Look well, and take good heed to the ending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be you never so gay;</span><br />
Ye think sin in the beginning full sweet,<br />
Which in the end causeth thy soul to weep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the body lieth in clay.'</span><br />
Here shall you see how fellowship and jollity,<br />
Both strength, pleasure, and beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will fade from thee as flower in May;</span><br />
For ye shall hear how our heaven king<br />
Calleth every man to a general reckoning:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give audience, and hear what he will say.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">God speaketh.</span></span><br />
<span class="smcap">God.</span> I perceive here in my majesty<br />
How that all creatures be to me unkind,<br />
Living without dread in worldly prosperity.<br />
Of ghostly sight the people be so blind,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Drown&egrave;d in sin, they know me not for their God;<br />
In worldly riches is all their mind.<br />
They fear not my righteousness, that sharp rod;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My law that I showed, when I for them died,</span><br />
They forget clean, and shedding of my blood so red.<br />
I hanged between two thieves, it cannot be denied,<br />
To get them life, I suffered to be dead;<br />
I healed their feet&mdash;with thorns hurt was my head&mdash;<br />
I could do no more than I did, truly.<br />
And now I see the people do clean forsake me;<br />
They use the seven deadly sins damnable;<br />
As pride, covetise, wrath, and lechery,<br />
Now in the world be made commendable;<br />
And thus they leave of angels the heavenly company.<br />
Every man liveth so after his own pleasure,<br />
And yet of their life they be not sure.<br />
I see the more that I them forbear<br />
The worse they are from year to year.<br />
All that liveth appaireth fast,<br />
Therefore I will in all the haste<br />
Have a reckoning of every man's person,<br />
For, and I leave the people thus alone<br />
In their life and wicked tempests,<br />
Verily they will become much worse than beasts,<br />
For now one would by envy another up eat;<br />
Charity they all do clean forget.<br />
I hoped well that every man<br />
In my glory should make his mansion,<br />
And thereto I had them all elect,<br />
But now I see that, like traitors deject,<br />
They thank me not for the pleasure that I to them meant,<br />
Nor yet for their being that I them have lent.<br />
I proffered the people great multitude of mercy,<br />
And few there be that asketh it heartily;<br />
They be so cumbered with worldly riches<br />
That needs on them I must do justice,<br />
On every man living without fear.<br />
Where art thou, Death, thou mighty messenger?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Almighty God, I am here at your will,<br />
Your commandement to fulfil.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">God.</span> Go thou to Everyman<br />
And show him, in my name,<br />
A pilgrimage he must on him take,<br />
Which he in no wise may escape;<br />
And that he bring with him a sure reckoning,<br />
Without delay or any tarrying.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Lord, I will in the world go run over all,<br />
And truly outsearch both great and small,<br />
Everyman I will beset that liveth beastly,<br />
Out of God's laws, and dreadeth not folly.<br />
He that loveth riches I will strike with my dart,<br />
His sight to blind, and from heaven depart,<br />
Except that alms-deeds be his good friend,<br />
In hell for to dwell, world without end.<br />
Lo, yonder I see Everyman walking!<br />
Full little he thinketh on my coming!<br />
His mind is on fleshly lusts, and his treasure,<br />
And great pain it shall cause him to endure<br />
Before the Lord, heaven king.<br />
Everyman, stand still! whither art thou going<br />
Thus gaily? Hast thou thy Maker forgot?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Why askest thou?<br />
Wouldest thou wot?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Yea, sir, I will show you:<br />
In great haste I am sent to thee,<br />
From God out of his Majesty.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> What! sent to me?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Yea, certainly.<br />
Though thou hast forgot Him here,<br />
He thinketh on thee in the heavenly sphere,<br />
As, or we depart, thou shalt know.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> What desireth God of me?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> That shall I shew thee:<br />
A reckoning he will needs have,<br />
Without any longer respite.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> To give a reckoning longer leisure I crave;<br />
This blind matter troubleth my wit.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> On thee thou must take a long journey,<br />
Therefore thy book of count with thee thou bring&mdash;<br />
For turn again thou cannot by no way&mdash;<br />
And look thou be sure of thy reckoning;<br />
For before God shalt thou answer, and shew<br />
Thy many bad deeds, and good but a few&mdash;<br />
How thou hast sped thy life, and in what wise&mdash;<br />
Before the chief Lord of Paradise.<br />
Have ado that we were in that way,<br />
For wot thou well thou shalt make none attorney.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Full unready I am such reckoning to give,<br />
I know thee not; what messenger art thou?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> I am Death, that no man dreadeth,<br />
For every man I rest, and none spareth;<br />
For it is God's commandement<br />
That all to me should be obedient.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> O Death, thou comest when I had thee least in mind!<br />
In thy power it lieth me to save;<br />
Yet of my good will I give thee, if ye will be kind,<br />
Yea, a thousand pound shalt thou have,<br />
And defer this matter till another day.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Everyman, it may not be by no way:<br />
I set not by gold, silver, nor riches,<br />
Ne by pope, emperor, king, duke, ne princes;<br />
For, and I would receive giftes great,<br />
All the world I might get&mdash;<br />
All my custom is clean contrary;<br />
I give thee no respite; come hence and not tarry.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Alas! shall I have no longer respite?<br />
I may say Death giveth no warning.<br />
To think on thee it maketh my heart sick,<br />
For all unready is my book of reckoning.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>But twelve years, and I might have abiding,<br />
My counting book I would make so clear<br />
That my reckoning I should not need to fear;<br />
Wherefore, Death, I pray thee for God's mercy,<br />
Spare me, till I be provided of remedy.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Thee availeth not to cry, weep, and pray,<br />
But haste thee lightly that thou were gone the journey,<br />
And prove thy friendes if thou can;<br />
For wot you well the tide abideth no man,<br />
And in the world each living creature,<br />
For Adam's sin, must die of Nature.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Death, if I should this pilgrimage take,<br />
And my reckoning surely make,<br />
Show me, for saint charity,<br />
Should I not come again shortly?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> No, Everyman; and thou be once there,<br />
Thou must never more come here,<br />
Trust me, verily!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Gracious God, in high seat celestial,<br />
Have mercy on me in this most need!<br />
Shall I have no company, from this vale terrestrial,<br />
Of mine acquaintance, that way me to lead?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Yea, if any be so hardy<br />
That would go with thee, and bear thee company.<br />
Hie thee that thou were gone to God's Magnificence<br />
Thy reckoning to give before His presence!<br />
What! weenest thou thy life is given thee,<br />
And thy worldly goods also?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> I had weened so, verily!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Nay, nay! it was but lent thee;<br />
For as soon as thou art gone<br />
Another a while shall have it, and then go therefrom<br />
Even as thou hast done.<br />
Everyman, thou art mad! that hast thy wittes five,<br />
And here on earth will not amend thy life!<br />
For suddenly I do come!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh, wretched caitiff! whither shall I flee,<br />
That I might scape this endless sorrow?<br />
Now, gentle Death, spare me till to-morrow,<br />
That I may amend me<br />
With good advisement.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Death.</span> Nay, thereto I will not consent,<br />
Nor no man will I respite,<br />
But to the heart suddenly I shall smite,<br />
Without any advisement.<br />
And now out of sight I will me hie;<br />
See thou make thee ready shortly,<br />
For thou may'st say this is the day<br />
That no man living may scape away.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Alas! I may well weep with sighes deep!<br />
Now have I no manner of company<br />
To help me in my journey, and me to keep;<br />
And also my writing is full unready.<br />
How shall I do now for to excuse me?<br />
I would to God I had never be gete!<br />
To my soul a great profit it had be,<br />
For now I fear pains huge and great.<br />
The time passeth&mdash;Lord, help, that all wrought!<br />
For though I mourn it availeth nought;<br />
The day passeth and is almost ago&mdash;<br />
I wot not well what to do&mdash;<br />
To whom were I best my complaint to make?<br />
What and I to Fellowship thereof spake,<br />
And showed him of this sudden chance?<br />
For in him is all mine affiance.<br />
We have in the world, so many a day,<br />
Been good friends in sport and play;<br />
I see him yonder certainly!<br />
I trust that he will bear me company;<br />
Therefore to him will I speak to ease my sorrow:<br />
Well met, good Fellowship, and good morrow!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Fellowship</span> <i>speaketh</i>.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Everyman, good morrow! by this day,<br />
Sir, why lookest thou so piteously?<br />
If anything be amiss, I pray thee, me say,<br />
That I may help to remedy.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Yea, good Fellowship, yea,<br />
I am in great jeopardy!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> My true friend, show to me your mind;<br />
I will not forsake thee unto my life's end&mdash;<br />
In the way of good company.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> That is well spoken, and lovingly!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Sir, I must needs know your heaviness;<br />
I have pity to see you in any distress!<br />
If any have you wronged, ye shall reveng&egrave;d be,<br />
Though I on the ground be slain for thee,<br />
Though that I know before that I should die!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Verily, Fellowship, gramercy!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Tush! by thy thanks I set not a straw!<br />
Show me your grief, and say no more.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> If I my heart should to you break,<br />
And then you to turn your mind from me,<br />
And would not me comfort, when you hear me speak,<br />
Then should I ten times sorrier be.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Sir, I say as I will do in deed.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Then be you a good friend at need!<br />
I have found you true here before.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> And so ye shall evermore;<br />
For in faith, and thou go to hell<br />
I will not forsake thee by the way!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Ye speak like a good friend; I believe you well;<br />
I shall deserve it, and I may.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> I speak of no deserving, by this day!<br />
For he that will say, and nothing do,<br />
Is not worthy with good company to go;<br />
Therefore show me the grief of your mind,<br />
As to your friend most loving and kind.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> I shall show you how it is:<br />
Commanded I am to go a journey&mdash;<br />
A long way, hard and dangerous&mdash;<br />
And give a strait count, without delay,<br />
Before the high judge Adonay;<br />
Wherefore, I pray you, bear me company<br />
As ye have promised, in this journey.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> That is matter indeed! promise is duty;<br />
But and I should take such a voyage on me,<br />
I know it well it should be to my pain;<br />
Also it maketh me afeard, certain.<br />
But let us take counsel here as we can,<br />
For your words would fear a strong man.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Why! ye said if I had need,<br />
Ye would me never forsake, quick ne dead,<br />
Though it were to hell, truly!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> So I said, certainly;<br />
But such pleasures be set aside, the sooth to say,<br />
And also, if we took such a journey,<br />
When should we come again?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Nay, never again till the Day of Doom.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> In faith, then will not I come there;<br />
Who hath you these tidings brought?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Indeed, Death was with me here.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Now, by God that all hath bought,<br />
If Death were the messenger,<br />
For no man that is living to-day<br />
I will not go that loathsome journey,<br />
Not for the father that begat me!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Ye promised me otherwise, pardie!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> I wot well I said so, truly,<br />
And yet if thou wilt eat and drink and make good cheer,<br />
Or haunt to women, that lusty company,<br />
I would not forsake you while the day is clear,<br />
Trust me verily!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Yea, thereto ye would be ready,<br />
To go to mirth, solace, and play;<br />
Your mind to folly will sooner apply<br />
Than to bear me company in my long journey.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Nay, in good faith, I will not that way,<br />
But and thou wilt murder, or any man kill,<br />
In that I will help thee with a good will.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh, that is a simple advice, indeed!<br />
Gentle fellow, help me in my necessity!<br />
We have loved long, and now I need,<br />
And now, gentle Fellowship, remember me.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Whether ye have loved me or no,<br />
By Saint John I will not with thee go!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Yet, I pray thee, take the labour and do so much for me<br />
To bring me forward, for saint charity,<br />
And comfort me till I come without the town.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Nay, and thou would give me a new gown<br />
I will not one foot with thee go;<br />
But and thou had tarried I would not ha' left thee so.<br />
And as now, God speed thee in thy journey!<br />
For from thee I will depart as fast as I may.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Whither away, Fellowship? wilt thou forsake me?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> Yea, by my fay; to God I betake thee!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Farewell, good Fellowship! for thee my heart is sore.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>Adieu! for I shall never see thee no more.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Fellow.</span> In faith, Everyman, farewell now at the end!<br />
For you I will remember that parting is mourning.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Alack! shall we thus depart indeed?<br />
Oh Lady, help! without any more comfort,<br />
Lo! Fellowship forsaketh me in my most need.<br />
For help in this world whither shall I resort?<br />
Fellowship here before with me would merry make,<br />
And now little sorrow for me doth he take.<br />
It is said, in prosperity men friends may find,<br />
Which in adversity be full unkind<br />
Now whither for succour shall I flee,<br />
Sith that Fellowship hath forsaken me?<br />
To my kinnesmen I will, truly,<br />
Praying them to help me in my necessity.<br />
I believe that they will do so,<br />
For kind will creep where it may not go.<br />
I will go say, for yonder I see them go:<br />
Where be ye now, my friends and kinnesmen?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> Here be we now at your commandement:<br />
Cousin, I pray you, show us your intent<br />
In any wise, and do not spare.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Cousin.</span> Yea, Everyman, and us to declare<br />
If ye be disposed to go any whither,<br />
For wot ye well, we will live and die together.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> In wealth and woe we will with you hold,<br />
For over his kin a man may be bold.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Gramercy! my friends and kinsmen kind:<br />
Now shall I show you the grief of my mind.<br />
I was commanded by a messenger,<br />
That is a high king's chief officer;<br />
He bade me go a pilgrimage to my pain,<br />
But I know well I shall never come again.<br />
Also I must give reckoning strait,<br />
For I have a great enemy that hath me in wait,<br />
Which intendeth me for to hinder.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> What account is that which ye must render?<br />
That would I know.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Of all my works I must show,<br />
How I have lived and my dayes spent;<br />
Also of ill deeds that I have used<br />
In my time, sith life was me lent,<br />
And of all virtues that I have refused;<br />
Therefore, I pray you, go thither with me,<br />
To help to make mine account, for saint charity!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Cousin.</span> What! to go thither? is that the matter?<br />
Nay, Everyman, I had liefer fast, bread and water,<br />
All this five year and more.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Alas, that ever I was born!<br />
For now shall I never be merry<br />
If that you forsake me.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> Ah, sir, what! ye be a merry man!<br />
Take good heart to you, and make no moan;<br />
But one thing I warn you&mdash;by Saint Anne,<br />
As for me, ye shall go alone!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> My cousin, will you not with me go?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Cousin.</span> No, by our Lady! I have the cramp in my toe!<br />
Trust not to me, for so God me speed,<br />
I will deceive you in your most need!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> It availeth not us to 'tice;<br />
Ye shall have my maid, with all my heart!<br />
She loveth to go to feasts, there to be nice,<br />
And to dance, and abroad to start;<br />
I will give her leave to help you in that journey,<br />
If that you and she may agree.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Now show me the very effect of your mind:<br />
Will you go with me or abide behind?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Kindred.</span> Abide behind? Yea, that will I, and I may,<br />
Therefore farewell, till another day!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> How should I be merry or glad?<br />
For fair promises men to me do make,<br />
But when I have most need they me forsake.<br />
I am deceived&mdash;that maketh me sad.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Cousin.</span> Cousin Everyman, farewell now!<br />
For verily I will not go with you.<br />
Also of my own an unready reckoning<br />
I have to account, therefore I make tarrying.<br />
Now God keep thee! for now I go.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Ah, Jesus! is all come hereto?<br />
Lo! fair words maketh fools fain!<br />
They promise, and nothing will do, certain!<br />
My kinnesmen promised me faithfully<br />
For to abide with me steadfastly,<br />
And now fast away do they flee;<br />
Even so Fellowship promised me.<br />
What friend were best me of to provide?<br />
I lose my time here longer to abide.<br />
Yet in my mind a thing there is&mdash;<br />
All my life I have loved riches;<br />
If that my Good now help me might,<br />
It would make my heart full light.<br />
I will speak to him in this distress:<br />
Where art thou, my Goods and Riches?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Who calleth me? Everyman? what! hast thou haste?<br />
I lie here in corners, trussed and piled so high,<br />
And in chests I am locked full fast,<br />
Also sacked in bags&mdash;thou mayst see with thine eye&mdash;<br />
I cannot stir; in packs low I lie.<br />
What would ye have? lightly me say.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Come hither, Good, in all the haste thou may,<br />
For of counsel I must desire thee.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Sir, and ye in the world have trouble or adversity,<br />
Then can I help you to remedy shortly.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> It is another disease that grieveth me;<br />
In this world it is not&mdash;I tell so&mdash;<br />
I am sent for, another way to go,<br />
To give a strait account general<br />
Before the highest Jupiter of all.<br />
And all my life I have had joy and pleasure in thee,<br />
Therefore, I pray thee, go with me;<br />
For peradventure thou mayest, before God Almighty,<br />
My reckoning help to clean and purify;<br />
For it is said, ever among,<br />
That money maketh all right that is wrong.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Nay, Everyman, I sing another song!<br />
I follow no man in such voyages,<br />
For and I went with thee,<br />
Thou should'st fare much the worse for me;<br />
For because on me thou did set thy mind,<br />
Thy reckoning I have made blotted and blind,<br />
That thine account thou cannot make truly,<br />
And that hast thou for the love of me.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> That would grieve me full sore,<br />
When I should come to that fearful answer.<br />
Up! let us go thither together!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Nay, not so! I am too brittle, I may not endure;<br />
I will follow no man one foot, be thou sure.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Alas! I have thee loved, and had great pleasure<br />
All my life's days on good and treasure.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> That is to thy damnation, without leasing,<br />
For my love is contrary to the love everlasting;<br />
But if thou had me loved moderately, during,<br />
As to the poor to give part for me,<br />
Then shouldest thou not in this dolour be,<br />
Nor in this great sorrow and care.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Lo now! I was deceived or I was ware!<br />
And all I may wyte my spending of time.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> What! weenest thou that I am thine?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> I had weened so.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Nay, Everyman, I say no!<br />
As for a while I was lent thee,<br />
A season thou hast had me in prosperity.<br />
My conditions is man's soul to kill;<br />
If I save one, a thousand I do spill.<br />
Weenest thou that I will follow thee<br />
From this world? nay, verily!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> I had weened otherwise.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Therefore to thy soul Good is a thief;<br />
For when thou art dead, this is my guise&mdash;<br />
Another to deceive, in the same wise<br />
As I have done thee, and all to his soul's reprief.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh false Good, cursed thou be!<br />
Thou traitor to God, thou hast deceived me<br />
And caught me in thy snare!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> Marry! thou brought thyself in care,<br />
Whereof I am glad;<br />
I must needs laugh, I cannot be sad.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Ah, Good, thou hast had my heartly love!<br />
I gave thee that which should be the Lord's above.<br />
But wilt thou not go with me indeed?<br />
I pray thee truth to say.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Goods.</span> No, so God me speed!<br />
Therefore farewell, and have good day!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh, to whom shall I make my moan,<br />
For to go with me in that heavy journey?<br />
First Fellowship, he said he would with me go&mdash;<br />
His wordes were very pleasant and gay&mdash;<br />
But afterward he left me alone;<br />
Then spake I to my kinsmen, all in despair,<br />
And also they gave me wordes fair&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>They lacked no fair speaking&mdash;<br />
But all forsake me in the ending.<br />
Then went I to my Goods, that I loved best,<br />
In hope to have comfort, but there had I least,<br />
For my Goods sharply did me tell<br />
That he bringeth many in hell.<br />
Then of myself I was ashamed,<br />
And so I am worthy to be blamed:<br />
Thus may I well myself hate.<br />
Of whom shall I now counsel take?<br />
I think that I shall never speed<br />
Till that I go to my Good Deed,<br />
But alas! she is so weak<br />
That she can neither go nor speak,<br />
Yet will I venture on her now:<br />
My Good Deeds, where be you?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> Here I lie, cold in the ground;<br />
Thy sins have me so sore bound<br />
That I cannot stir.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh, Good Deeds, I stand in fear!<br />
I must you pray of counsel,<br />
For help now should come right well.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> Everyman, I have understanding<br />
That thou art summoned account to make<br />
Before Messias, of Jerusalem King;<br />
And you do by me, that journey with you will I take.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Therefore I come to you, my moan to make;<br />
I pray thee to go with me.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> I would full fain, but I cannot stand, verily!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Why? is there anything on you fall?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> Yea, sir; I may thank you of all.<br />
If ye had perfectly cheered me,<br />
Your book of account full ready now had be.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Look! the books of your workes and deedes eke,<br />
Behold how they lie under the feet,<br />
To your soules heaviness!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Our Lord Jesus helpe me!<br />
For one letter herein can I not see.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> There is a blind reckoning in time of distress.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Good Deeds, I pray you help me in this need,<br />
Or else I am for ever damned indeed;<br />
Therefore help me to make my reckoning<br />
Before the Redeemer of all thing,<br />
That King is, and was, and ever shall.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> Everyman, I am sorry of your fall,<br />
And fain would I help you, and I were able.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Good Deeds, your counsel I pray you give me.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> That shall I do, verily!<br />
Though that on my feet I may not go,<br />
I have a sister, that shall with you also,<br />
Called Knowledge, which shall with you abide,<br />
To help you to make that dreadful reckoning.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide,<br />
In thy most need to go by thy side.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> In good condition I am now in everything<br />
And am wholly content with this good thing:<br />
Thanked be God, my Creator!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> And when he hath brought thee there<br />
Where thou shalt heal thee of thy smart,<br />
Then go thou with thy reckoning and thy good deeds together,<br />
For to make thee joyful at the heart,<br />
Before the Blessed Trinity.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> My good Deeds, I thank thee heartily;<br />
I am well content, certainly,<br />
With your wordes sweet.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Now go we thither, lovingly,<br />
To confession, that cleansing river.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> For joy I weep! I would we were there!<br />
But I pray you to instruct me by intellection,<br />
Where dwelleth that holy virtue, Confession?<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> In the house of salvation;<br />
We shall find him, in that place,<br />
That shall us comfort, by God's grace.<br />
Lo! this is Confession; kneel down and ask mercy,<br />
For he is in good conceit with God Almighty.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh glorious fountain, that all uncleanness doth clarify,<br />
Wash from me the spots of vices unclean,<br />
That on me no sin may be seen!<br />
I come with Knowledge, for my redemption,<br />
Redeemed with heart, and full of contrition;<br />
For I am commanded a pilgrimage to take,<br />
And great accounts before God to make.<br />
Now I pray you, Shrift, mother of salvation,<br />
Help my Good Deeds, for my piteous exclamation!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Confession.</span> I know your sorrow well, Everyman;<br />
Because with Knowledge ye come to me<br />
I will you comfort, as well as I can,<br />
And a precious jewel I will give thee,<br />
Called penance, voider of adversity;<br />
Therewith shall your body chastised be,<br />
With abstinence, and perseverance in God's service.<br />
Here shall you receive that scourge of me<br />
Which is penance strong, that ye must endure,<br />
To remember thy Saviour was scourged for thee<br />
With sharp scourges, and suffered it patiently.<br />
So must thou, or thou scape that painful pilgrimage:<br />
Knowledge, keep him in this voyage,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>And by that time Good Deeds will be with thee;<br />
But in any wise be sure of mercy&mdash;<br />
For your time draweth fast&mdash;and ye will saved be;<br />
Ask God mercy and He will grant, truly.<br />
When with the scourge of penance man doth him bind,<br />
The oil of forgiveness then shall he find.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Thanked be God for His gracious work!<br />
For now I will my penance begin:<br />
This hath rejoiced and lighted my heart,<br />
Though the knots be painful and hard within.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Everyman, your penance look that ye fulfil,<br />
What pain that ever it to you be,<br />
And Knowledge will give you counsel at will,<br />
How your accounts ye shall make clearly.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Oh eternal God! Oh heavenly figure!<br />
O way of righteousness! Oh goodly vision!<br />
Which descended down in a virgin pure,<br />
Because He would every man to redeem,<br />
Which Adam forfeited by his disobedience;<br />
Oh blessed Godhead elect and high divine,<br />
Forgive me my grievous offence!<br />
Here I cry thee mercy in this presence.<br />
Oh Ghostly treasure! O Ransomer and Redeemer<br />
Of all the world! Hope and Conductor!<br />
Mirror of joy and Founder of mercy,<br />
Which illumineth heaven and earth thereby,<br />
Hear my clamorous complaint, though it late be!<br />
Receive my prayers, of thy benignity!<br />
Though I be a sinner most abominable,<br />
Yet let my name be written in Moses' table!<br />
Oh Mary! pray to the Maker of all thing,<br />
Me for to help at my ending!<br />
And save me from the power of my enemy,<br />
For death assaileth me strongly;<br />
And, Lady, that I may by means of thy prayer,<br />
Of thy Son's glory to be partaker,<br />
By the means of His Passion, I it crave:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>I beseech you, help my soul to save!<br />
Knowledge, give me the scourge of penance;<br />
My flesh therewith shall give a quittance&mdash;<br />
I will now begin, if God give me grace.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Everyman, God give you time and space!<br />
Thus I bequeath you in the hands of our Saviour;<br />
Thus may you make your reckoning sure.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> In the name of the Holy Trinity,<br />
My body sore punished shall be!<br />
Take this, body, for the sin of the flesh,<br />
Also thou delightest to go gay and fresh,<br />
And in way of damnation thou did me bring,<br />
Therefore suffer now strokes and punishing!<br />
Now of penance I will wade the water clear,<br />
To save me from hell and from the fire.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Good Deeds.</span> I thank God, now I can walk and go!<br />
I am delivered of my sickness and woe;<br />
Therefore with Everyman I will go, and not spare;<br />
His good works I will help him to declare.<br />

Therefore I will abide with thee in every stound.<br />

<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Be no more sad, but ever more rejoice;<br />
God seeth thy living in His throne above.<br />
Put on this garment to thy behove,<br />
Which with your tears is now all wet,<br />
Lest before God it be unsweet<br />
When you to your journey's end come shall.<br />

From pain it will you borrow&mdash;<br />
Contrition it is,<br />
That getteth forgiveness,<br />
It pleaseth God passing well.<br />

In the way of charity, with good intent;<br />
And the other half still shall remain<br />
In quiet, to be returned there it ought to be.<br />
This I do in despite of the fiend of hell,<br />
To go quite out of his peril,<br />
Ever after and this day.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> Everyman, hearken what I say:<br />
Go to priesthood, I you advise,<br />
And receive of him, in any wise,<br />
The Holy Sacrament and ointment together;<br />
Then shortly see ye turn again hither:<br />
We will all abide you here.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Five Wits.</span> Yea, Everyman, hie you that ye ready were<br />
There is no emperor, king, duke, ne baron,<br />
That of God hath commission,<br />
As hath the least priest in the world being;<br />
For of the Blessed Sacraments, pure and benign,<br />
He beareth the keys and thereof hath he cure;<br />
For man's redemption it is ever sure,<br />
Which God, for our soul's medicine,<br />
Gave us out of his heart with great pain.<br />
Here in this transitory life, for thee and me,<br />
The Blessed Sacraments Seven there be;<br />
Baptism, Confirmation, with Priesthood good,<br />
And the Sacrament of God's precious flesh and blood;<br />
Marriage, the Holy Extreme Unction, and Penance.<br />
These seven be good to have in remembrance,<br />
Gracious sacraments of high divinity.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Everyman.</span> Fain would I receive that Holy Body,<br />
And meekly to my ghostly father I will go.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Five Wits.</span> Everyman, that is the best that ye can do:<br />
God will you to salvation bring,<br />
For good priesthood exceedeth all other thing.<br />
To us holy scripture they do teach,<br />
And converteth man from sin, heaven to reach.<br />
God hath to them more power given<br />
Than to any angel that is in heaven.<br />
With five words he may consecrate,<br />
God's body in flesh and blood to make,<br />
And handleth his maker between his hands.<br />
The priest bindeth and unbindeth all bands<br />
Both in earth and in heaven.<br />
Thou ministers all the sacraments seven&mdash;<br />
Though we kiss thy feet thou were worthy&mdash;<br />
Thou art surgeon that cureth sin deadly.<br />
No remedy we find under God<br />
But all only priesthood.<br />
Everyman, God gave priests that dignity,<br />
And setteth them in his stead, among us to be;<br />
Thus be they above angels in degree.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Knowledge.</span> If priests be good, it is so surely;<br />
But when Jesus hung on the cross with great smart,<br />
There he gave, out of his blessed heart,<br />
The same sacrament, in great torment;<br />
He sold them not to us, that Lord omnipotent:<br />
Therefore Saint Peter the Apostle doth say,<br />
That Jesus' curse hath all they<br />
Which God their Saviour do buy or sell,<br />
Or they for any money do take or tell.<br />
Sinful priests giveth the sinners example bad;<br />
Their children sitteth by other men's fires, I have heard,<br />
And some haunteth women's company,<br />
With unclean life, as lusts of lechery:<br />
These be with sin made blind.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Five Wits.</span> I trust to God no such may we find!<br />
Therefore let us priesthood honour,<br />
And follow their doctrine for our souls' succour.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>We be their sheep, and they shepherds be,<br />
By whom we all be kept in surety.<br />
Peace! for yonder I see Everyman come,<br />

I thank God that ye have tarried so long&mdash;<br />

<h4>I</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/hscroll.png" alt="H" /></span>umbly complaineth unto your gracious Highness your poor orator and
humble subject John Rastell, that where your said orator delivered to
one Henry Walton certain parcels of stuff and goods to the value of 20
marks, safely to keep to the use of your said orator, that is to say,
a player's garment of green sarcenet lined with red tuke and with
roman letters stitched upon it of blue and red sarcenet, and another
garment paned with blue and green sarcenet lined with red buckram, and
another garment paned likewise and lined as the other, with a cape
furred with white cats, and another garment paned with yellow, green,
blue, and red sarcenet, and lined with red buckram. Another garment
for a priest to play in, of red Say, and a garment of red and green
Say, paned and guarded with gold skins, and fustians of Naples black,
and sleeved with red, green, yellow, and blue sarcenet. And another
garment, spangled, of blue satin of Bruges, and lined with green
sarcenet. Also two old short garments, paned of satin Bruges and of
sarcenet of divers colours in the bodies. Also a woman's garment of
green and blue sarcenet, chequered and lined with red buckram, also
two caps of yellow and red sarcenet, and two curtains of green and
yellow sarcenet. Also two long broad pieces of blue linen cloth, with
lyre in them. Also three pieces of open silvered linen cloths; also
one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> long broad piece of red buckram. Which said stuff and goods the
said Walton promised to deliver again to your said orator, whensoever
he should be by your said orator thereto required. Which said stuff
and goods, after the said delivery to him made, the said Walton
occupied at his pleasure, by the space of half a year and more, during
the time that your said orator was in the parts beyond the sea, in
France. After whose coming home your said orator demanded of the said
Walton relivery of the said stuff and goods, to whom the said Walton
answered and said that he would bring him home the said goods and
stuff, yet that notwithstanding he brought to him no part thereof, but
drove him forth from time to time, by the space of two or three weeks,
during which time the said Walton, unknown to your said orator, which
was every day continually in the said city, and constantly in company
with the said Walton, craftily, falsely, by the subtle advice and
counsel of a clerk of the Mayor's Court in the City of London, and by
a Sergeant of the same Court, entered a false feigned plaint, put in
bill in the said Court, against your said orator, supposing that your
said orator should owe to the said Walton 40 shillings stirling,
wherein indeed your said orator owed him never a penny, and by the
custom of the said City made attachment of the said goods and stuff
being in his own hands, and caused that one John Wilkinson, plasterer,
and one Thomas Curtis, were assigned to be pricers; which Wilkinson,
at the request and desire of the said Henry, priced the said goods and
stuff but to the value of 35s. 9d., which goods and stuff at that time
were well worth 20 marks and above. Upon which pricement the said
Henry had judgement to recover the said goods and stuff, for the which
your said orator can never have remedy by course of the common law;
and though your said orator within the year did put in surety to
answer to the said plaint and bill, and to disprove the said action,
yet your said orator could never, nor shall never by the order of the
common law, there recover again the said stuff and goods, but shall
recover no more for them but only the sum wherefor they were priced,
which is but 35s. 9d. as is before said; and so hath and shall, by
such falsehood, subtlety, and design of the said Walton, and of the
said Wilkinson and Curtis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> which were pricers, lose 11 or 12 pounds or
above, and is without remedy therefore for ever, except your gracious
Highness be showed to him in this behalf. In consideration whereof it
may please your Grace and your most honourable Council to command one
of your officers of arms to go to the said Henry Walton and to the
said John Wilkinson and Thomas Curtis, and to command them in your
name to appear before your Grace and your honourable Council at
Westminster, there to answer to the premises and there to be directed
according to right and good conscience; and your said orator and
subject shall daily pray for the preservation of your Royal estate,
long to endure.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p class="center"><i>The answer of</i> <span class="smcap">Henry Walton</span> <i>to the Bill of Complaint of</i> <span class="smcap">John
Rastell</span> <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>The said Henry Walton by protestation saith, that the said goods in
the bill of complaint of the said John Rastell mentioned, be not of so
great value as in his said bill of complaint is supposed. And saith
that the said bill of complaint is uncertain, and insufficient in the
law to be answered unto, and the matter therein contained feigned and
craftily imagined, to the intent to put the said Henry Walton to great
costs and expenses. Nevertheless, for answer and declaration of the
truth, the said defendant saith that it appeareth by the bill of the
said complainant that he hath no cause of action in this honourable
court, for it appeareth by his bill of complaint that the said goods
be recovered in the King's Court holden before the Mayor and Aldermen
of the City of London, according to the custom of the said City. And
further, the defendant saith that he brought an action of debt against
the said John Rastell of 40s. in the said court; and he, the said
Henry Walton, having in his own keeping the said goods in the said
bill of complaint supposed, attached them in his own hands, according
to the custom of the said City; which goods were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> afterwards, by the
commandment of the said court, by the said John Wilkinson and Thomas
Curtis, were praised at 35s. 9d. And where the said John Rastell, in
his said bill of complaint, saith that the goods aforesaid were
praised much under their value, the said Henry Walton saith that they
were praised to as much as they at the time of the praisement were
worth. And where the said complainant in his said bill of complaint
saith that he oweth not the said defendant the said 40s. and is
without remedy, the said Henry Walton will aver that the said John
Rastell oweth him the said 40s. And also the said Henry saith that the
said John Rastell might have come into the said court, holden before
the Mayor and Aldermen aforesaid, within the year and the day
according to the custom, and there to have put in sureties, and so to
have dissolved the attachment, but hath suffered and s....psed his time.
And the said Henry Walton shall aver that the said goods were of no more
value than they were priced at, for they were rotten and torn players'
garments. Without that that the said Henry Walton craftily or falsely,
and by subtle advice of his counsel, commenced the said action against
the said John Rastell, in manner and form as he in his said bill untruly
hath alleged. And without that that anything being material or effectual
in the said bill, otherwise than in the said answer of the said Henry,
is alleged is true. And in as much as the said goods be lawfully
recovered in the King's Court, holden before the Mayor and Aldermen in
the City of London aforesaid, being a Court of Record, the which record
cannot be undone without errer or attaint, therefore the said Henry
Walton prayeth to be dismissed out of this honourable court, with his
reasonable costs and expenses for his wrongful vexation, &amp;c.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>The replication of</i> <span class="smcap">John Rastell</span> <i>to the Answer of</i>
<span class="smcap">Henry Walton</span>.</p>

<p>The said John Rastell saith that his said bill is true, and certain,
and sufficient to be answered unto, and matter determinable in this
honourable court, and will aver every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>thing to be true contained in
the said bill of complaint; and that the said answer is uncertain and
insufficient to be answered unto, and matter feighed and untrue. And
further saith that the said John Rastell, as soon as he had knowledge
that the said Walton had commenced the said action of debt of 40s. in
the said Mayor's Court in London, the said Rastell came into the said
court and there put in surety to the said action. Whereupon the said
Walton declared against the said Rastell that the said Rastell should
owe to the said Walton 40s., for that that the said Rastell confessed
himself in the said City of London to owe to the said Walton 40s., to
the which the said Rastell answered and tended his law, according to
the custom of the said City, that he owed nothing to the said Walton
in manner and form as the said Walton against him declared. Whereby
the said Walton perceived that upon the said plea and tender his said
action should be dissolved; demurred in law upon the same plea, which
demurrer, what for lack that the Recorder of the said City and other
Councillors can have no convenient time to argue the said matter, and
also for lack that the counsel for the said Walton was not ready when
the said matter of law should be argued, the said matter as yet doth
depend there undiscussed. But yet the said John Rastell saith that if
the said matter be discussed and judged for the said Rastell, as
undoubtedly it will be, yet the said Rastell, by the custom of the
said City, shall never recover again his said goods, nor stuff, but
only 35s. 9d. for the said stuff, so that in the said court he hath no
other remedy nor record to punish the said Walton nor the said
praisers for their said deceit and falsehood in praising of the said
goods and stuff at 35s. 9d., which were worth at that time 20 marks
and above, as in the said bill of complaint is alleged; for the great
part of the said goods were garments of silk and other stuff, fresh
and newly made, with much workmanship done upon them, to the great
cost and charge of your said orator, without that that the said goods
were at the time of the said appraisement of no more value than they
were praised at. And without that that they were gone rotten and torn
players' garments, for the said Rastell saith that the said Walton
hath letten them out to hire to divers stage-plays and interludes, and
hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> received and had for the hire of them since the said praisement
of them the sum of 20 nobles and above. And without that that any
other thing material or effectual in this said answer alleged
necessary to be replied unto is true. All which matters your said
orator is ready to prove and aver as this court will award, and
prayeth as he prayed in his said bill.</p>

<p>William Fishpole of London, tailor, of the age of 60 years and above,
sworn and examined upon his oath, saith that he made two long gowns
down to the ground, of sarcenet, one of them of blue and yellow
sarcenet, lined with red tuke or red buckram, whether of the same
lining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> he now remembereth not, and another of green sarcenet, but
whether it were lined or not he remembereth not now, which gowns
coming to him in pieces contained in every piece 6 ells or
thereabouts. And also he saith that if he should have bought out of
the mercer's shop, every ell would have cost 6s.; and he saith that
every gown was worth 20s. and above. And also he saith that he made a
garment for a gallant with wide sleeves, the one side of red and
yellow sarcenet, and the other side blue and red lined with red tuke
or red buckram, which was a costly garment, better than 20s. And if
they had been bought of new stuff it would have cost much more money.
And also he saith he made a woman's gown of sarcenet, blue and yellow,
as he remembereth, and it was made in quarrels or lozenges, he
remembereth not whether, and was a busy work, and Mistress Rastell did
help to sew that, and part of the gallant's gown also. And it was
lined with red tuke or buckram and garnished with gold skins, as he
remembereth, and it was better than 20s. and it was worth a noble the
making. And how long he was in making of them he remembereth not, but
he had 4d. by the day, meat and drink. And further he saith that he
hath heard say, that the said Rastell lent to Walton the said
garments, and that he used them in stage-plays. And further he saith
that there was a short spangled garment of blue satin of Bruges, and
was lined with green sarcenet, which was better than any of the other
garments; which he made not, but every one of them, one with another,
were better than 20s., and more he knoweth not herein.</p>

<p>George Mayler of London, merchant tailor, of the age of 40 years,
sworn and examined upon his oath, saith that he knew the said
garments, but how many there be in number he remembereth not, for he
hath occupied and played in them by the lending of Walton, and he
saith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> they were worth 20s. apiece and better. And he saith he knoweth
well that he lent them out about 20 times to stage-plays in the summer
and interludes in the winter, and used to take at a stage-play for
them and others, sometimes 40d., sometimes 2s., as they could agree,
and at an interlude 8d. for every time. But how many times he
perfectly knoweth not, but by estimation 20 times a year in
interludes. And he saith that he hath seen the curtains of sarcenet,
but how many ells they contained he knoweth not, but it was worth 40d.
every ell, and he saith that he had buckram and tuke, but how many
yards he knoweth not, but it was better than 2d. a yard; and further
he saith that the summer when the King's banquet was at Greenwich, he
saw the same garments occupied in divers stage-plays, and occupied
part of them himself by the lending of other players that Walton had
lent them to hire, which then were fresh and little worse for the

<p>George Birch of London, carrier, of the age of 32 years or
thereabouts, sworn and examined saith, that he knew well a player's
garment lined with red tuke and stitched with Roman letters upon it of
blue and red sarcenet; another garment paned with blue and green
sarcenet, lined with red buckram, and another garment paned with
yellow, green, red, and blue sarcenet, lined with old red buckram;
another garment spangled of blue satin of Bruges, lined with green
sarcenet, and a woman's gown or garment of green and blue sarcenet,
checked and lined with red buckram; in which garments this deponent
and his company played in while they remained in the hands of the said
Rastell. And he saith that every garment, one with another, were worth
20s., and that Walton did let out the same garments to hire to stage
plays and interludes sundry times, but how many times he knoweth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> not.
And further he saith that the common custom is at an interlude 8d. for
the garments, and at a stage play as the parties can agree. And he
saith if they had been made of new stuff they had been much more
worth. And he saith he saw the curtains of sarcenet, but how many ells
they were he knoweth not, but every ell was worth 3s. And further he
saith that 3 or 4 years past, when the King's banquet was at Greenwich
that summer, he saw the said garments played in 3 or 4 times, by the
lending of the said Walton, and at that time they seemed fresh and
good garments, and more he knoweth not.</p>

many was of them he remembreth not; and this deponent played in the

knoweth not, but they were little worse than new. And this deponent

but what hire he had for them he knoweth not, neither in stage-play
nor in interludes; but as to the 6 garments, that is to say 4 gowns of
sarcenet, a woman's gown, and a spangled garment, they were good,
fresh, and little the worse for the occupying when he knew them first
in Walton's hands, and by estimation they were worth 20s. apiece, for
they were lined and guarded part with gilt leather; and the curtains
of silk were fresh and new; and there were garments of dornyke and
saye, which he well remembereth, and more he cannot say.</p>

<p>*This is incorrect, Archbishop <span class="smcap">Arundell</span> condemned Sir <span class="smcap">John Oldcastle</span>
on September 25th, 1413, who was then sent to the Tower, see <i>pp.</i> 125,
132: from which he escaped; and being recaptured in Wales in 1417, was
burnt on the 14th December of that year. But in the meantime, Archbishop
<span class="smcap">Arundell</span> had died on the 14th February, 1414; and <span class="smcap">Henry Chicheley</span> had become Archbishop.</p>
